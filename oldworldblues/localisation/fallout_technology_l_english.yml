 explosive_tech:0 "Dynamite"
 explosive_tech_desc:0 "2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, clay and stabilisers packed into a cardboard tube with a fuse. A simple, but effective, tool for mining, quarrying and, more obviously, blowing our enemies to kingdom come."
 explosive_tech_2:0 "Precise Targeting I"
 explosive_tech_2_desc:0 "The explosive radius of dynamite allows us to mostly throw it in the general direction of the enemy and hope for the best, but we can do better; by training our soldiers to throw their dynamite precisely into groups of enemies or at the feet of singular opponents, we can increase the deadliness of dynamite."
 explosive_tech_3:0 "Mortars"
 explosive_tech_3_desc:0 "Highly portable, muzzle loaded, simple to manufacture, and capable of delivering death from above, mortars are a firing team's best friend."
 explosive_tech_4:0 "Precise Targeting II"
 explosive_tech_4_desc:0 "By training our firing teams to understand wind direction, parabolic arcs, testing shots and other essentially targeting techniques, we can increase their effectiveness at blowing the enemy to smithereens."
 explosive_tech_5:0 "Howitzers"
 explosive_tech_5_desc:0 "Though less portable than the mortar, the rifling of the howitzer allows for greater range and muzzle velocities, making them even deadlier."
 explosive_tech_6:0 "Precise Targeting III"
 explosive_tech_6_desc:0 "By attaching targeting equipment to our howitzers we can make our cannoneers more effective at using this relatively advanced weapon."

 flamer_tech:0 "Fire Gecko Pouches"

 flamer_tech_2:0 "Potent Fuel I"
 flamer_tech_2_desc:0 "By refining our removal of the sulphurous glands and further tinkering with their volatility, we have been able to make smaller pouches explode into bigger flames."
 flamer_tech_3:0 "Flamers"
 flamer_tech_3_desc:0 "The flamer uses a gas projection system to expel a flammable liquid (the name is lost, the formula is not) that is then ignited by a small flame in the tip of the muzzle, causing the burning stream to emerge and coat enemies, setting the on fire more rapidly that many other methods."
 flamer_tech_4:0 "Potent Fuel II"
 flamer_tech_4_desc:0 "Refinements in the liquid mixture and the gas projection system have allowed us to create flamers that spray further and a liquid that burns hotter and longer than any before it."
 flamer_tech_5:0 "Incinerators"
 flamer_tech_5_desc:0 "The incinerator is weaker than the flamer in terms of per second damage output, but it is more effective at longer rangers, allowing our soldiers to rain hellfire upon the enemy at ranges that the flamer never could."
 flamer_tech_6:0 "Potent Fuel III"
 flamer_tech_6_desc:0 "By further refining the gas projection system and increasing the gaseous throughput, we have been able to increase the incinerators range and rate of fire, allowing more shots more quickly over a greater range."

 anti_tank_tech_2:0 "Unpredictable Attacks I"
 anti_tank_tech_2_desc:0 "Training anti-tank troops to work in pairs instead of within the larger infantry unit allows greater ability to surprise armoured units for anti-tank units on the ground."
 anti_tank_tech_3:0 "Basic Rocket Launchers"
 anti_tank_tech_3_desc:0 "Salvaged rocket launchers provide significantly more penetration and destructive power than mere rifles at greater effective range."
 anti_tank_tech_4:0 "Unpredictable Attacks II"
 anti_tank_tech_4_desc:0 "Using anti-tank units as maneuverable units on their own taking shots and then using established escape plans to reposition before taking the next makes it much easier for anti-tank units to continuously provide support."
 anti_tank_tech_5:0 "Missile Launchers"
 anti_tank_tech_5_desc:0 "High tech rocket launchers using shaped charges and accurate, long range rockets can destroy almost any armoured unit easily from a distance."

 anti_personnel_tech_desc:0 "Machine guns can provide significant boosts in firing output mowing down enemy soft targets in the open with ease."
 anti_personnel_tech_2:0 "Fear Factor I"
 anti_personnel_tech_2_desc:0 "Rather than only firing when seeing targets directly, suppressing enemies by laying down fire nearby to the enemy will help keep the enemies heads down and limit their ability to return fire."
 anti_personnel_tech_3:0 "Heavy Machine Guns"
 anti_personnel_tech_3_desc:0 "Getting heavier guns available to the front lines that have more heft and hence less recoil and better heat transfer allows more sustained fire against the enemy than possible with cruder machine guns."
 anti_personnel_tech_4:0 "Fear Factor II"
 anti_personnel_tech_4_desc:0 "Using a support gunner instead of just one gunner per weapon allows much faster reloading allowing bullets to come practically in a continuous stream."
 anti_personnel_tech_5:0 "Miniguns"
 anti_personnel_tech_5_desc:0 "Miniguns are hulking, extremely heavy machine guns capable of firing a laser beam of pure firepower."

 dog_tech_3:0 "Purebred Mutts"
 dog_tech_3_desc:0 "Through selective breeding of some of the finer mongrel specimens, you have managed to create a stable breed of viable war dog."
 dog_tech_4:0 "Toxic Wounds II"
 dog_tech_4_desc:0 "Though our purebreds no longer carry the diseased bite of the mongrels, their trust allows us to do something worse; we have given them metal teeth, rusty and jagged, that will causing bleeding and invite disease into the wounds our dogs inflict."

 dog_tech_5_desc:0 "The processes thought long forgotten, you have somehow managed to begin a production line of Cyberhound MKII personal security models."
 dog_tech_6:0 "Toxic Wounds III"
 dog_tech_6_desc:0 "Because the Cyberhound MKII has a more robust physiology than a non-augmented dog, and is more easily customised, we can do the unthinkable; we have made the saliva of our hounds actively venomous, not just causing infection, also poisoning our enemies, stopping their hearts, freezing their brains."
