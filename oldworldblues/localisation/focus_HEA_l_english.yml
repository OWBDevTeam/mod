 hea_nf_precursers:0 "Legacy of Scripture"
 hea_nf_precursers_desc:0 "The word of God has always been the supreme law of the land, even in times where Heaven's Gate has been lead by more moderate leaders. These divine writings have always inspired our people, generation after generation."

 hea_nf_pilgrims:0 "Pilgrims Cometh"
 hea_nf_pilgrims_desc:0 "Pilgrims have travelled to our lands, whether intentionally or unintentionally, for the better part of several decades. For these people, churches and shrines have been built, yet one has always been more popular than the other!"

 hea_nf_tribals:0 "Pagan Conversion"
 hea_nf_tribals_desc:0 "Tribals have come to join our flock time and time again, sometimes individuals, sometimes entire tribes. Their arrival can never be predicted, and often strain our resources."

 hea_nf_innocence_lost:0 "Innocence Lost"
 hea_nf_innocence_lost_desc:0 "The Tragedy at Innocence Lost can never be understated. The rage of the Pagan fell upon the peaceful pilgrim, and it is said that the blood spilt there stains the ground red to this day. A word of warning to all faithful."

 hea_nf_pol_action:0 "The Great Debate"
 hea_nf_pol_action_desc:0 "The legacy of the Great Debate is ancient, dating back to the years following the great war, wherein the people feared violence might break out between the people of differing faiths. Instead, on each sunday, all who have faith in God are encouraged to do intellectual and theological battle with one another, where all can see."

 hea_nf_embrace_elite:0 "Victory to the Clergy"
 hea_nf_embrace_elite_desc:0 "The Clergy quite nearly lost the hearts and minds of the people to the sheer charisma and audacity of the young Prophet, yet it can be said that cooler heads inevitably triumphed. For even the Prophet cannot debate a small army of wizened minds, every Sunday. Inevitably, even he sees the wisdom in their words."

 hea_nf_embrace_elite_1:0 "Council of Christ"
 hea_nf_embrace_elite_1_desc:0 "Now Christened the Council of Christ, the elders of the city, joined by the prophet, move forward with their usual plans and agenda. They seek to unify the all people under God, and focus heavily on bringing more lost souls to mass."

 hea_nf_reject_elite:0 "The Prophet Prevails"
 hea_nf_reject_elite_desc:0 "The Words of the prophet have quite literally been written on the subway walls, down below the city. In households, dining halls, and sacred places, his words are spoken. The Great Debate has become less a debate, and more a rallying call to all who wish to see him cast down the Old Elite, through wit, word, and sheer willpower."

 hea_nf_reject_elite_1:0 "The Archangel Rises"
 hea_nf_reject_elite_1_desc:0 "All who would stand against the will of the Prophet have been subdued, and those who remain kneel in his presence. Divinity walks among us, and with him comes the word of God. There are none who can consider the Theocratic Elite anything but pretenders in his presence, for surely, this man has God on his side."

 hea_nf_consolidate_pol:0 "Religious Evolution"
 hea_nf_consolidate_pol_desc:0 "A time of change is upon us, and the people flock to Heaven's Gate! They drop to their knees in our churches, and whisper eager prayers to our lord, asking forgiveness and mercy. The world is changing, and at last? Religion changes with it."

 hea_nf_grand_cathedral:0 "The Billowing Cathedral"
 hea_nf_grand_cathedral_desc:0 "In the very heart of the Heaven's Gate there has always been a massive, ruined cathedral, a relic of the old world that survived where all other things crumbled to ruin and dust. The renovation of this cathedral has been the work of a thousand men, over several decades. Choir call all within the city to mass, and the smoke calls all within a hundred miles to the city."

 hea_nf_innocence_lost_deal:0 "Memories of Innocence"
 hea_nf_innocence_lost_deal_desc:0 "Innocence was, true to its namesake, a peaceful town of kind souls, doing what they could to survive in the wasteland. For their faith and kindness, they were butchered by uncertain and fearful Pagan masses. There are few alive today who do not still weep for a lost loved one, taken back by misery and uncertainty. In time, what will this fear become?""

 hea_nf_forgive_sins:0 "Learning to Forgive"
 hea_nf_forgive_sins_desc:0 "Hatred is not the way of God, nor is it intrinsic to the heart of mankind. The world has bled enough, suffered enough because men and women could not let go. We have been given a second chance in what remains of our lord's greatest creation, so let us not taint this with the same spite that ruined it."

 hea_nf_fog_of_mercy:0 "Mercy for the Wicked"
 hea_nf_fog_of_mercy_desc:0 "Those Pagans who once butchered Innocence fled from us for decades, fearing what would happen when we caught them, fearing the wrath of our God. Yet when we found them? We offered mercy to all who would take it, and word of that mercy spread like wildfire through the land. In the eyes of all who look upon us, we are remembered for this kindness."

 hea_nf_vengance:0 "An Eye for an Eye"
 hea_nf_vengance_desc:0 "And have we forgotten the Plagues? The walls of Jericho? The drowned armies of the Pharaoh? Mercy goes to those who deserve it, and we can never forgive them for what they have done. Let it be known to all who remember Innocence, and to all who hear of it. The wicked will suffer the vengeance of the faithful."

 hea_nf_boilers_of_justice:0 "Boiled Alive"
 hea_nf_boilers_of_justice_desc:0 "Those Pagans once butchered Innocence fled for as far as their legs could take them, scattered to the wind and in a hundred directions. Once every few months, such a man or woman is caught and dragged back to Heaven's Gate, where they are forgiven, but after being punished for their sin. Baptised in boiling water, so that they might travel to heaven and beg the forgiveness of those they struck down."

 hea_nf_addres_militarism:0 "A Culture of War?"
 hea_nf_addres_militarism_desc:0 "Long ago, Heaven's Gate was a largely peaceful community nestled high in the mountains. Warriors were few, for our threats were few. Yet times change, and smoke rises from manufactories and weapons shops, young men march in lockstep, preparing for wars they believe will come. The loss of Innocence has changed the very way we look at the world, and how we react to it shall forever shape our nation."

 hea_nf_embrace_militarism:0 "Embracing Violence"
 hea_nf_embrace_militarism_desc:0 "And what good has mercy given the faithful? If we can not defend our people, what good is our faith? What good are our dreams? We must learn to protect ourselves to prevent yet another tragedy. The arms of the faithful are filled with the strength of man and God."

 hea_nf_embrace_militarism_1:0 "The Tenth Crusade"
 hea_nf_embrace_militarism_1_desc:0 "The Crusades are a thing of legend, for so little is known of them. It is said that an army of the faithful rose up to cast down false prophets, to march forth and defend against the heathen masses. Man and woman, grandfather and grandson, all answer the call, and all prepare for the war against the enemies of God."

 hea_nf_fight_militarism:0 "The Rise of Mercy"
 hea_nf_fight_militarism_desc:0 "And what good are we if we become our enemies? If we give way to madness and violence? War is not who we are, nor will it ever be who we are. A bastion for good, a bastion for change. Heaven's Gate shall be the heart of God's kingdom on earth, and no Kingdom of God shall go forth to butchered those who know no better."

 hea_nf_fight_militarism_1:0 "Sanctuary for All"
 hea_nf_fight_militarism_1_desc:0 "All who are lost may come to the Gate. Those fleeing persecution, those fleeing slavery, those fleeing their conquerors. All of whom and are willing to believe may find Sanctuary within our walls, and in time? Our home shall become their home, our food shall become their food, and our faith shall become their faith."

 hea_nf_army:0 "Evolution of the Guard"
 hea_nf_army_desc:0 "For the better part of a hundred years, Heaven's Gate has been protected by the Guard, an unofficial alignment of disjointed militia and mercenaries who have little to no formal interaction with one another, beyond a unified goal of protecting the gate. Evolving this organization into a true military shall be no simple task."

 hea_nf_army_1:0 "Arming the Clergy"
 hea_nf_army_1_desc:0 "The greatest among our warriors have always been the clergy and preachers, those who go out into this barren and dangerous world with a small book and a proper big iron, dedicated to bringing god's mercy to those in need, and god's wrath upon those who deserve it. Allowing these men to teach and arm the clergy shall be the first step to a proper fighting force."

 hea_nf_conscription:0 "Mandatory Service"
 hea_nf_conscription_desc:0 "Among the citizenry, there is often little to no desire to go forth and fight, to go forth and kill, yet it is the duty of any good Christian to protect their home, their family, and those who can't protect themselves. Mandatory service is a means to an end, a method through which we shall fill out the ranks on our holy mission, but more than that, it is the will of our god."

 hea_nf_crusaders:0 "Crusader Armies"
 hea_nf_crusaders_desc:0 "Among our citizenry, there are those of zealous mind and holy body who feel that it is their duty to wage war upon the infidel and bring god to this begotten land. The so called crusaders march forth, chanting prayers and training daily with the dreams of the day when they shall not have to take up arms fresh on their minds. Until such a day? They shall fight and pray for Heaven's Gate."

 hea_nf_army_2:0 "Military Ordos"
 hea_nf_army_2_desc:0 "Those among our ranks who feel that there is a singular need for violence also believe in a mastery of war. To wage war upon the forgotten, one must first know of war. The Ordos Military is a subsection of the church who dedicate themselves to studying biblical battles, historical records, and modern examples of large scale war, so that they might better learn and master it."

 hea_nf_air:0 "The Race to Heaven"
 hea_nf_air_desc:0 "The Race to Heaven is something of a misleading name for a cultural phenomenon that was established thirty years ago by an elderly preacher named Darren Shaw, who challenged the young minds of the Gate to reach for the heavens from his deathbed. While this was undoubtedly a philosophical statement, many young engineers believed it a challenge, and invitation to rebuild the flying machines of old."

 hea_nf_air_knight:0 "Blessing of the Angels"
 hea_nf_air_knight_desc:0 "It is said that those who fly, and have flown, only do so because the angels, and by extension, god allow them too. If such is true, than it can be said that all of those among us who take to the skies do so with the blessing of those angels, and the blessing of a beloved god. Let those who dare to soar do so the the confidence that such faith can inspire."

 hea_nf_air_peasant:0 "Wings of the Angels"
 hea_nf_air_peasant_desc:0 "Those who fly are said to sore, but not all who soar do so within planes. To truly soar, one must embrace the experience, be free in mind and soul, spirit and body. To this end, those who fly and wish to soar must know that the wings that carry them are not made from metal, fibre, nor are they powered by fuel or reactor. The wings of the angels carry those who soar, and those who know this will know no fear."
 hea_add_30_fighters_tt:0 "Adds §H30§! Scrap Fighters to our stockpiles."
 
 hea_nf_air_1:0 "Ascension Achieved"
 hea_nf_air_1_desc:0 " Those who fly on our behalf fear not the fall, nor the rise, for they know in their heart of hearts that their soul has already risen. Their bodies are but vessels for the will of the lord, as they are the few who have risen high enough to see with the naked eye that which was the world god created, the ruined beauty of that which we squandered. Death is a mercy, and death in his name? An honour."

 hea_nf_missionary_warriors:0 "Armed Pilgrims"
 hea_nf_missionary_warriors_desc:0 "Those who journey to Heaven's Gate have often travelled miles uncountable, across land and water, against threat of death and rumination. They have seen with the naked eye what remains of God's kingdom on earth, and know every path that there is to be travelled. This knowledge, above all other things, gives us an advantage in times of strife and regrettable violence."

 hea_nf_officer_priests:0 "Cleric Generals"
 hea_nf_officer_priests_desc:0 "There are few things in the world that can motivate a man or woman to move quicker than the a short hymn for the grace of a powerful verse. The Cleric Generals do not only lead our armies, they guide them through what remains of the world, ensuring that both spirit and body remain strong all the while."

 hea_nf_community_service:0 "Community Service"
 hea_nf_community_service_desc:0 "The duty one owes to Heaven's Gate is second to none, for it is the last true bastion of godliness left in this world, powered not only by the steam of nuclear fusion, but by the wills, hearts and minds of the faithful. All who live must do their part for the cause of God, striving against mind and body to build a tomorrow worthy of being called home."

 hea_nf_path_of_steam:0 "Expanding the Pipelines"
 hea_nf_path_of_steam_desc:0 "The Pipelines that run from the city of Heaven's Gate are more than highways through which heat and fuel are carried to the larger kingdom. They are highways that pilgrims travel down, and missionaries travel up. They are the promise of water and warmth to the sick and cold in our realm, the constant reminder that they are not forgotten, not forsaken. To expand such lines is to expand faith."

 hea_nf_school_of_steam:0 "Clerical Education"
 hea_nf_school_of_steam_desc:0 "The minds of the youth are often forgotten in the wasteland, filled only with the bare necessities. What it takes to build a shelter, what it takes to clean a gun, to survive the harshness of this new world. Yet among our kind Clerical Education is available to all who wish to have it, for a few prayers and the promise of encouraging others to seek it."

 hea_nf_school_of_steam_industry:0 "Steam Powered Factories"
 hea_nf_school_of_steam_industry_desc:0 "The steam that runs from the special fusion reactors in the Heart of Heavens Gate, gifts from our ancestors, preserved by the will of god, is what allows us to thrive when so many others fail and fall. It is our duty to bring this steam to all within our domain, for the heat and power provided by it warms our people and fuels our industry."

 hea_nf_school_of_steam_motorisation:0 "Engine Innovation"
 hea_nf_school_of_steam_motorisation_desc:0 "It is said that oil killed the war, oil and other finite fuels and powers. Things that could not be replaced with fusion and steel. If only the technology we now use had been perfected sooner, maybe it could have all been avoided. Regardless, we now have the means with which to improve the very vehicles that brought about the end."

 hea_nf_school_of_steam_aviation:0 "Rebuilding Airports"
 hea_nf_school_of_steam_aviation_desc:0 "Scattered across the land are ruined stretches of flat land, filled with potholes, ruined machines, and broken pavement. The ruined machines that remain in these airports are key to our efforts to rebuild the sky fleets of old..."

 hea_nf_machines_of_steam:0 "Steam-powered Dreadnoughts"
 hea_nf_machines_of_steam_desc:0 "Across the wasteland, individuals strive to rebuild the oldest weapons of war, those metal-bound goliaths that once shattered those armies that dared oppose the might of the American military. Using our unique steam-fusion technology, we are able to solve one of the most common problems with this type of technological advance, that is to say, powering these machines in a way that is efficient."

 hea_nf_men_of_steam:0 "Steam-Power Armour"
 hea_nf_men_of_steam_desc:0 "Power armour is, at its core, a remarkably inefficient system of fighting a war. Only those with access to vast stockpiles of fusion cores and similar power sources are capable of moving such monstrous units. Using our own technology, we are capable of powering these rudimentary units with an ease and swiftness usually lost to those around us."

 hea_nf_age_of_steam:0 "A New Age"
 hea_nf_age_of_steam_desc:0 "The Steam-Fusion reactors have taken us far and beyond what any might have expected, allowing our military to reach heights previously thought impossible by all but the greatest of nations or technophiles. The blessing of steam allowed us to become what we are, and with that blessing? We shall usher in an new age, "

 hea_nf_industry:0 "Developing the Gate"
 hea_nf_industry_desc:0 "The Gate is the seat of our power, from which all of our influence and faith stems. Building the city further is the utmost priority of our people, for once the gate is built to its fullest, will the lands around it truly prosper as they did before the war. Only then can we begin rebuilding that which was loss."

 hea_nf_industry_1:0 "Coer Grace"
 hea_nf_industry_1_desc:0 "By the grace of God almighty, the order has been handed down from the church itself. The Coer Hills are to be rebuilt as a center of commerce and industry. From the river of prosperity that shall arise from this land shall our people continue their mission to rebuild the world."

 hea_nf_industry_2:0 "Steam Grace"
 hea_nf_industry_2_desc:0 "By the grace of God almighty, the order has been handed down from the church itself. The Steam is to be rebuilt as a center of commerce and industry. From the river of prosperity that shall arise from this land shall our people continue their mission to rebuild the world."

 hea_nf_industry_3:0 "Talache Grace"
 hea_nf_industry_3_desc:0 "By the grace of God almighty, the order has been handed down from the church itself. Talache is to be rebuilt as a center of commerce and industry. From the river of prosperity that shall arise from this land shall our people continue their mission to rebuild the world."

 hea_nf_industry_4:0 "Verlorene Grace"
 hea_nf_industry_4_desc:0 "By the grace of God almighty, the order has been handed down from the church itself. Verlorene Spur is to be rebuilt as a center of commerce and industry. From the river of prosperity that shall arise from this land shall our people continue their mission to rebuild the world."

 hea_nf_industry_mil_1:0 "Coer Blessing"
 hea_nf_industry_mil_1_desc:0 "By the will of God almighty, the order has been passed down by the prophet himself. The Coer Hills are to become a center of war and weapons manufacturing. From the mighty arms that shall flow from this land shall we gain the strength needed to reshape this world."

 hea_nf_industry_mil_2:0 "Steam Blessing"
 hea_nf_industry_mil_2_desc:0 "By the will of God almighty, the order has been passed down by the prophet himself. The Steam is to become a center of war and weapons manufacturing. From the mighty arms that shall flow from this land shall we gain the strength needed to reshape this world."

 hea_nf_industry_mil_4:0 "Verlorene Blessing"
 hea_nf_industry_mil_4_desc:0 "By the will of God almighty, the order has been passed down by the prophet himself. Verlorene is to become a center of war and weapons manufacturing. From the mighty arms that shall flow from this land shall we gain the strength needed to reshape this world."

 hea_nf_industry_5:0 "Rebirth of the Gate"
 hea_nf_industry_5_desc:0 "Heaven's gate is reborn, and from all across the wasteland come those seeking wealth and power. Arms manufacturers travel great distances to sell to us, caravans flow to our capital, and for the first time in ages? The city is larger than the ruins that it was once build within. For the first time since the great war, the city truly grows."

 hea_nf_foreign_ministry:0 "Embassy of Christ"
 hea_nf_foreign_ministry_desc:0 "Our blessed nation lies within the heart of Idaho, centred around the mighty Steam and Heaven's Gate: a place where the children of God can gaze upon four states at once. It is no mistake that two Christian nations reside within the south of our holy state. Although they have strayed from the true path, God's message is clear to the prophet: we must invite them into our home and show them the true way of God."

 hea_nf_embassy_murtaugh:0 "Speaking with Protestants"
 hea_nf_embassy_murtaugh_desc:0 "The men and women of Murtaugh follow the good book, albeit, the wrong version of that book. Their hatred with their neighbours is admittedly, foolish, but one can not question the sheer devotion and zeal with which they approach their divine duty."

 hea_nf_defensive_league:0 "Brotherhood with Murtaugh"
 hea_nf_defensive_league_desc:0 "Murtaugh has sent its pilgrims to us, and we have sent ours to them. And as the word of god is shared commonly and openly between us, the sense of brotherhood between our people grows. With this growth comes a greater understanding of their conflicts, we know now why the heretical Ires are an insult to god!"

 hea_nf_strike_ires:0 "Striking the Catholics"
 hea_nf_strike_ires_desc:0 "The Ires are to be put down as the heretics they are, and while we are merciful, offering conversion to those who will take it, there is no doubt in the minds of our people that this conflict shall lead to great bloodless. The heretics are a stubborn lot after all."

 hea_nf_embassy_ires:0 "Speaking with Catholics"
