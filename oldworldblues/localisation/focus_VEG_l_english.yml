 veg_judgement_desc:0 "In 2065, House predicted that a nuclear exchange between the US and China would take place within the next 15 years, and decided to put all of his resources into protecting his home city of Las Vegas. He had his own hotel, the Lucky 38 Casino, fitted with radar-jamming systems, missile arrays, a laser defence network, and life-support systems."

 veg_software:0 "Incomplete OS"
 veg_software_desc:0 "Following the valiant defence of New Vegas, house was thrown into a violent coma, and the majority of his data and robots found themselves corrupted and inoperable for the following decades, silent protectors incapable of movement or thought. When House returned to consciousness, he had choices to make. Did he dare attempt to salvage his more advanced OS or did he simply fall back on a stable version?"

 veg_families:0 "Three Families"
 veg_families_desc:0 "House hopes to rebuild the world, and to do so he has to start by rebuilding his beloved Vegas. He begins with the 3 great Casinos that once rivalled his own lucky 38, going out to find groups suitable for such establishments, those who can be easily controlled, and bring Vegas the moxie it's going to need in the future."

 veg_newvegas:0 "New Vegas"
 veg_newvegas_desc:0 "The process of rebuilding Vegas didn't happen quickly, and between spending money hunting for his precious platinum chip and micromanaging the families of the strip, House has found himself more than occupied. Despite this, he did find the time and money to invest in Vegas itself."

 veg_oldauthority:0 "Old Authority"
 veg_oldauthority_desc:0 "Long ago? I ruled Vegas with my machines and my wealth. There were none in this city who could stand against me, and now? More than ever? That is true. They shall again learn to respect the name Robert House. My authority must be absolute if I am to save this world from the mess it has become."

 veg_house:0 "The House"
 veg_house_desc:0 "Vegas, or as they are now calling it, New Vegas, has been my home for so long as I can remember. It has been my home, my house, and it shall be the house from which the rest of the Wasteland is taught the lessons of old. My well laid plans are older than any can imagine, I can't allow myself to fail."

 veg_nwo:0 "New World Order"
 veg_nwo_desc:0 "The Wasteland is a vile and dangerous place, and the gangs herein are uncouth and violent in the extreme. Those who are not with my plans for peace are against them, and I shall humble them as I did business rivals long ago."

 veg_rockthesuburbs:0 "Clean the Suburbs"
 veg_rockthesuburbs_desc:0 "The Fiends have dominated the suburbs of new Vegas for too long! They terrorize the people of this great city, abusing the innocent so that they can fuel their empire of addiction."

 veg_secure:0 "Secure Power"
 veg_secure_desc:0 "The Hoover Dam still functioned after all these years, a much coveted bridge across the colorado, but more importantly? A source of electricity and power to any who dared try to claim it. I shall have it for myself, so soon as I clear our the local rabble."

 veg_broken:0 "Broken Steel"
 veg_broken_desc:0 "The Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel has been a pain in my back for so long as I have known of their existence. Stealing important pieces of technology, scrapping my creations, and robbing the people of New Vegas. I shall snuff them out."

 veg_reborn:0 "Hidden Valley Reborn"
 veg_reborn_desc:0 "The stockpiles of the Mojave Brotherhood are impressive indeed! Vast quantities of munitions, advanced technology, and other such things lay just below the ground. Digging them out is a small investment, but surely a worthy one."

 veg_securenorth:0 "Secure the North"
 veg_securenorth_desc:0 "The Great Khans are failures by in large, having been removed from their homelands numerous times. Indeed, they are losing a war against their own extinction, and I think it time to hurry them on a little."

 veg_clean:0 "Clean the Mojave"
 veg_clean_desc:0 "The raider gangs within the Mojave were not something I had planned on having to deal with, for they were initially too few in number to matter. Yet as small, defeated gangs trickle in from New California, their numbers and firepower continue to grow. It would be best to remove these pests before they become a true problem. "

 veg_frisco:0 "Reopen the Frisco Mines"
 veg_frisco_desc:0 "The Silvermines in Frisco had always been a personal goal of mine before the war, though I never found the time to get around to opening them, and those who owned the land were unfair with their pricing. But now? There is little that could be done to stop a hostile acquisition."

 veg_silver:0 "Silver Business"
 veg_silver_desc:0 "While rare metals aren't worth what they were before the war, they are still valuable in the extreme. The small but steady income from the Frisco mines is something that helps New Vegas to flourish, and more so? Something I can expand upon in the future."

 veg_architect:0 "Architect of Destiny"
 veg_architect_desc:0 "To say that I planned all of this would be a lie, but to say that I did not take that which I was given and create for myself something new and beautiful would be untrue. I have become the Architect of Destiny, and I shall build for myself a new world."

 veg_platinumchip:0 "The Platinum Chip"

 veg_vault:0 "The Vault"
 veg_vault_desc:0 "The Vault lies across the river, but it is not a challenge to smuggle in an individual capable of opening it, and retrieving for me my army, for there is no force in the wasteland that could stop their departure. They shall finally ensure the safety of my people."

 veg_prime:0 "Vegas Prime"
 veg_prime_desc:0 "The Liberty Prime Project was one of RobCo's most ambitious side projects, and to say that It didn't leave me inspired would be a lie! I set the groundwork for Vegas Prime, a smaller, more manageable variation of that mechanical giant, long ago."

 veg_economy:0 "Economic Miracle"
 veg_economy_desc:0 "New Vegas is going to need to thrive like it did before the War. In order to do that, it's going to need trade, gambling, and all the vices one can imagine. It's not hard to bring about mind you, and I know that the New Vegas will be an economic miracle, just like Vegas was before the bombs fell.."

 veg_foreigninvest:0 "Secure Foreign Investors"
 veg_foreigninvest_desc:0 "The Wasteland is full of eager thrillseekers and greedy souls desperate to earn a quick buck. Thankfully, New Vegas is just the place for such people. Every cap I've spent on advertising has made that abundantly clear to all searching for a new place to spend a little dough."

 veg_ncrembassy:0 "NCR Embassy"
 veg_ncrembassy_desc:0 "The New California Republic is a blessing in disguise, easily manipulated, desperate to have Vegas under their control, and with the greatest military this side of the Colorado River. Controlling them, leveraging their military might against outside threats, and exploiting their economic system is going to be essential to the future of New Vegas."

 veg_jointscavenge:0 "Joint Scavenging Company"
 veg_jointscavenge_desc:0 "The Scavengers from the NCR are diligent workers, and so used to picking over cities that have been scavenged for decades that they are constantly finding strong sources of metal within the ruins of New Vegas. Our own scavengers could learn a thing or two from them."

 veg_ncrrail:0 "NCR Rail Network"
 veg_ncrrail_desc:0 "The NCR has proposed the construction of an extensive rail network, in order to better protect against the encroaching might of the legion, and so that they might expedite trade with us. Both of these things are in line with my interests, and shall have my full financial backing."

 veg_ncrdeal:0 "NCR Trade Deal"
 veg_ncrdeal_desc:0 "The New California Republic has offered New Vegas the status of preferred trade Partner, which should allow for preferential treatment during trade negotiations and competitions on both parts. Nothing can come from this but increased NCR dependence on New Vegas, and wealth for my city. What more could a man ask for?"

 veg_newmanagement:0 "New Management"
 veg_newmanagement_desc:0 "Robert House is a relic of the past, a fool who doesn't understand the wasteland or the lives of the people within it. It'll take ambitious minds to bring New Vegas under new management, but thankfully there is no shortage of such minds in the city of sin."

 veg_king:0 "The King"
 veg_king_desc:0 "The King is the voice and soul of the people of New Vegas, the downtrodden many who lived in the ruins of the place before it became a bastion of civilization once again. Frustrated with the mistreatment of his people, and distrustful of the NCR, the King hopes to create a New Vegas that puts its people first."

 veg_everyman:0 "Every Man a King"
 veg_everyman_desc:0 " "The Kings are about an idea, you see? Where every man is free to follow his own path, do his own thing. Where every man is a king in his own right.” - The King  "

 veg_prepcity:0 "Prepare the City"
 veg_prepcity_desc:0 "If New Vegas is to grow, it shall need wealth inimaginable. Thankfully, it is ideally situated to attract just that, with rivers and roads leading to it from miles around, we must simply wait and prepare New Vegas for the wealth that is to come flooding into it."

 veg_segregate:0 "Segregate Vegas"
 veg_segregate_desc:0 "As sad is it is to admit, the poor of New Vegas leech wealth from the strip. They come in masses, building debts they can never repay, destabilizing the delicate balancing act that has brought us such wealth! Freeside should be walled and away from New Vegas, and if they seek to spend caps here? Let them prove they have the caps in the first place."

 veg_revitalize:0 "Revitalise Freeside"
 veg_revitalize_desc:0 "The Strip may be the wealthiest portion of New Vegas, but its people and its soul live in Freeside, with innumerable lesser shops and small homesteads. Offering them proper funding shall surely win over the love of the people of New Vegas."

 veg_vault21:0 "Vault 21"
 veg_vault21_desc:0 "The Vault below New Vegas is a source of great pride for the people of New Vegas, yet it could also be a source of great wealth. The secrets and resources in its lower levels are vast and important, yet it could easily be made into a simple and affordable method of housing the best clientele."

 veg_cerulean:0 "Cerulean Robotics"
 veg_cerulean_desc:0 "The Abandoned Cerulean Robotics facility, located just west of Freeside, has been out of operation since the bombs feel. Now that Vegas is thriving and the majority of the former RobCo installations are up and running again, it only makes sense that such a facility be converted."

 veg_followersupport:0 "Follower Support"
 veg_followersupport_desc:0 "The Followers of the apocalypse arrived in Vegas before House emerged from his coma, and were working to civilize the city for the betterment of mankind. It's not easy to earn their support, and they are idealists in their purest form. Their knowledge of medicine is vast and could prove to be quite the boon to our cause."

 veg_industry:0 "Kickstart Vegas"
 veg_industry_desc:0 "There are dozens of little shops and smaller casinos decorating Vegas, and among them? An insurmountable number of poor and impoverished people. Funding these shops so that they might employ those people would help to kickstart what little economy that isn't dependant on tourism we have."

 veg_walls:0 "The Walls of New Vegas"
 veg_walls_desc:0 "New Vegas is a coveted location, even now the NCR and Legion make moves to vie for its controls, the wills and thoughts of its rulers and people be damned. Protecting the city is a priority to all who care for such things, and protecting the city is exactly what we intend to do."

 veg_muggers:0 "Enlist the Muggers"
 veg_muggers_desc:0 "The Muggers are a particularly violent gang of women, many of whom the elderly widows of raiders who were slain out west, who have gained a reputation for being brutal and effective. That reputation could go far in establishing the King as a man who isn't to be underestimated."

 veg_followers:0 "Follower Integration"
 veg_followers_desc:0 "Among the followers, many idealists believe that the future of the Wasteland should belong to its people and neither of the regional superpowers. Integrating these individuals into our command structure should allow us to gain an edge technologically and morally."

 veg_securitron:0 "Securitron Studies"
 veg_securitron_desc:0 "The Securitrons of New Vegas record absolutely everything that happens within its walls, and with knowledge like that? You could learn almost anything about anyone. Knowing how to exploit this advantage is going to be key in throwing off the yoke of Mr. House."

 veg_vic:0 "General Victor"
 veg_vic_desc:0 "Victor is an oddity from the wasteland, a semi-independent Securitron with a personality unlike any other. Despite largely being a lackey for Mr. House, the removal of a few choice protocols should allow us to win him over using his cowboy sensibilities."

 veg_first:0 "Vegas First"
 veg_first_desc:0 "New Vegas belongs to the people of New Vegas! Our priorities should be the city itself, the people within, and it should be an objective of ours to avoid foreign entanglements."

 veg_mojavesecond:0 "Mojave Second"
 veg_mojavesecond_desc:0 "The Mojave to the south is home to dozens of small communities and settlements that are entirely dependant on New Vegas for their continued survival. It would take a simple act of intervention to win them over to our side!"

 veg_warforvegas:0 "War for New Vegas"
 veg_warforvegas_desc:0 "Waiting any longer puts the people of New Vegas at risk! We must rise now and cast House down from his tower. It won't be an easy battle, but it is a battle that we can and must win, for our future!"

 veg_mojave:0 "Mojave Alliance"
 veg_mojave_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel, to the south, has been a burden on the people of New Vegas for longer than anyone can remember, but they are also the strongest military force localized in the Mojave and as such, loyal to it over larger factions. An alliance could prove beneficial."

 veg_dambusters:0 "Invite the Dam Busters"
 veg_dambusters_desc:0 "The Dam Busters are a small group of advanced technophiles living in the shell of Hoover Dam. Their strategic location puts them at great risk, but then again? An alliance with them could put us in a position of great political power."

 veg_mojavesecure:0 "Secure the Mojave"
 veg_mojavesecure_desc:0 "The lesser raider gangs of the Mojave deserve to be expunged from the land! They have harmed our people and impeded our trade for too long."

 veg_assassinate:0 "Assassinate House"
 veg_assassinate_desc:0 "Mr. House is far too powerful to fight head on. Instead, a more cunning method, like assassination, must be employed to avoid bloodshed in the streets. Getting a man inside won't be easy, but who said things like this ever are?"

 veg_peoplesvegas:0 "Vegas for the People"
 veg_peoplesvegas_desc:0 "The King has done it! Vegas is won and conquered at last, and now free to chase its destiny. Whether that brings it into conflict with local superpowers, or if it merely enjoys a quiet existence of trade and prosperity, none can deny that it will be ready for whatever comes its way."

 veg_joker:0 "The Joker"
 veg_joker_desc:0 "Benny's been with House since the beginning, and there are no doubts as to who's the majordomo in New Vegas. The Joker isn't without his tricks, however; he's the wild card, and he intends to prove it by shaking up the status quo."

 veg_thugs:0 "Benny's Thugs"

 veg_hiredhelp:0 "Hired Help"
 veg_hiredhelp_desc:0 "Now and then it takes an expert to make great things happen. Thankfully, a genius by the name of Mr. Awesome has approached Benny on a recent job offer extended to him by outsiders, and is looking to feed the man insider information for a reasonable price."

 veg_yesman:0 "Yes Man"
 veg_yesman_desc:0 "Yes Man is the key to everything, an easy and effective way to take control over Houses entire security network, and by extension? All of New Vegas. Programming him isn't easy, but hells bells if it won't be worth it."

 veg_wrongpackage:0 "Wrong Package"
 veg_wrongpackage_desc:0 "Rumour has it a courier is moving something big on behalf of Mr. House. Or at least, that's what Benny's been telling his people, and he's also made it clear that he doesn't intend to let that package reach Mr. House."

 veg_crackthevault:0 "Cracking the Vault"
 veg_crackthevault_desc:0 "It's time to crack open Mr. House's secret weapon, a vault full of military grade robots that will enshrine Benny as the true power in the Mojave. All that he's gotta do is find a way to get to it, but that shouldn't be too hard. After all, even the legion won't turn away a trade caravan."

 veg_allin:0 "All-In"
 veg_allin_desc:0 "They say that Mr. House had the game rigged from the start, but little did they know the player was cheating. Benny had a wild card up his sleeve the entire time, and it's time for the House to pay out. The pot? All of New Vegas baby."

 veg_ringading:0 "Ring-a-Ding-Ding!"
 veg_ringading_desc:0 "Vegas belongs to the Chairmen! More importantly? It belongs to Benny, who's taken up Mr. House's place as ruler and leader of the general area. With all of houses resources at hand and more money than he could have ever dreamed of, Benny is set for life."

 veg_nevadapact:0 "The Nevada Pact"
 veg_nevadapact_desc:0 "There are dozens of small city-states scattered throughout Nevada, between Vegas, Reno and Vault City? You could form an empire in a few years. Who's to say they can't or shouldn't band together, just to stick it to the fat cats in the NCR, or the barbarians out Arizona way?"

 veg_familyman:0 "Family Man"
 veg_familyman_desc:0 "No one gets anywhere in this life without a little bit of help, a nice, healthy support structure to carry him through the bad times. Most people are lucky to have one family, But Benny? Benny has three he can call upon for support."

 veg_ultraluxethugs:0 "Ultra-Luxe Thugs"
 veg_ultraluxethugs_desc:0 "Fighting people from the Ultra-Luxe isn't like anything else in the wasteland. They are all outwardly formal and inwardly psychotic, taking a sickening glee in the damage they inflict."

 veg_compensation:0 "Family Compensation"

 veg_privatearmies:0 "Private Armies"
 veg_privatearmies_desc:0 "The New Vegas families all field small legion's of armed men and women, ready to enforce their will at a moments notice. A stockpile of weapons like these can be costly, but heavens above is it worthwhile in the long run."

 veg_aligned:0 "Aligning the Families"
 veg_aligned_desc:0 "Getting the families to work together is a key part of Benny's plan. It's going to involve flattery, bribery, marriage and no small amount of quiet murders, but at the end of the day? A united Vegas stands together and lives together."

 veg_checkereddevil:0 "Checkered Devil"
 veg_checkereddevil_desc:0 "Benny is legendary for his ability to backstab allies and make the impossible happen.

 veg_ultraluxe:0 "The Ultra-Luxe"
 veg_ultraluxe_desc:0 "The Ultra-Luxe is an establishment of incredible refinement that delicately conceals its operators' more questionable tendencies. There are none who can contest the idea that it's the classiest place on the strip."

 veg_abandon_desc:0 "What kind of a savage eats a man? The White Glove Society is beyond that! Reformed into a proper group of wastelanders with the noblest of intentions. Garnering as much wealth as possible from the wealthiest clientele."

 veg_khaganate:0 "The Khaganate"
 veg_khaganate_desc:0 "Even as a family, the Khans are a rowdy bunch who love to do battle with one another. Their Casino is host to some of the best-paid fights in all of Vegas. Boxing matches? Robot Brawls? Duels with knives? You name it, you can see it here."

 veg_pickelhaube:0 "Fancy Pickelhaubes"

 veg_chairmen:0 "The Chairmen"
 veg_chairmen_desc:0 "The Chairmen embody an ancient “cool” aesthetic of Vegas, plucked from Mr. House's historical data banks. Moulded to be the slickest cats in town, the Chairmen have become more than wannabe gangsters, they've become the genuine article, dangerous men playing dangerous games."

 veg_arms:0 "Arming the Chairmen"
 veg_arms_desc:0 "The Chairmen have always had an eye for what's hip, be it in the nice suits they wear, the snazzy casino they live in, or the soothing rat-a-tat-tat of the underslung Tommy guns they wield against those unlucky enough to insult their dames. Guns like that don't come cheap, but thankfully they've got caps to spare."

 veg_newdeal:0 "Benny's New Deal"
 veg_newdeal_desc:0 "The Chairmen are the most profitable casino on the strip, and wealth like that lets them throw a lot of weight around when it comes high time for the families to decide what nobody business is getting what amount of caps as trickle down from the strip."

 veg_kings:0 "The Kings"

 veg_westside:0 "Rebuilding Westside"
 veg_westside_desc:0 "Despite being based on the strip, The Kings have their hearts set on the Westside, where the King himself was once worshipped as a legend of rock and roll. In his honor, and in the name of the people living there, They work to make it a better, safer place."

 veg_north:0 "Secure the North"
 veg_north_desc:0 "Westside might be a safe place these days, but Vegas is bigger than Westside! Bigger than any side, and the kings intend to make sure that everyone knows it.

 veg_gomorrah:0 "Gomorrah"
 veg_gomorrah_desc:0 "Where The Strip's other casinos are refined, the Gomorrah is rough around the edges and coarse, as it offers sleazy sex for sale. Top of the attractions list is prostitution, then booze and drugs, and finally gambling."

 veg_consig:0 "The Consiglieres"
 veg_consig_desc:0 "The Fiends were given a new identity by House, that of the Consiglieres. Styled after the Sicilian mob, they are the new tough men of Vegas, a violent bunch who outdo all other gangs when it comes to sheer intimidation and debaucherous lifestyles.

 veg_skullsandsuits:0 "Skulls and Suits"
 veg_skullsandsuits_desc:0 "The Consiglieres aren't allowed to wear or display bones of humans, but that doesn't stop them from displaying bones.

 veg_securitrons1_desc:0 "The PDQ-88b securitron produced by House Industries supports only two operating systems: Mk I and Mk II.

 veg_security_desc:0 "The Outer Vegas Security force is the closest thing to a standing, non-robotic army New Vegas has had since the families rolled into town. Volunteers armed with the best the strip can provide, risking their lives to protect the interests of the city."

 veg_vehicles:0 "Vehicle Restoration"
 veg_vehicles_desc:0 "A lot of places in the wasteland like to put cars back together. We're a bit behind on the uptake, but New Vegas is more than capable of sustaining that industry. We might as well invest."

 veg_mobile:0 "Mobile Warfare"
 veg_mobile_desc:0 "Vehicles are great for trade, but they are just as valuable in times of war. A small force of eager young souls has formed a small scouting group on behalf of Vegas."

 veg_militia:0 "Militia Arms"
 veg_militia_desc:0 "The Local Militias, from each of the little settlements and communities, have requested weapons with which to defend themselves. Selling them at a discount is a good way to ensure our safety and sustainable business."

 veg_boomers:0 "The Boomer Agreement"
 veg_boomers_desc:0 "The Boomers to the north are a bit of a wild card when it comes to interaction. Half as likely to blow you to pieces as they are to engage in a sane conversation… but. The promise of planes is enough to bait them into an official alliance with New Vegas."

 veg_lakemead:0 "Lake Mead's Superfortress"
 veg_lakemead_desc:0 "The Superfortress below lake mead is a true treasure, but so is our capacity to replicate it. For a handful of these? We can enshrine our alliance with the Boomers once and for all."

 veg_warlabs:0 "War Labs"
 veg_warlabs_desc:0 "War never changes, but the weapons we use in it most certainly do. If we're going to fight our foes, we'll need to evolve just as the wasteland has."

 veg_justlikethesim:0 "Just like the Simulations"
 veg_justlikethesim_desc:0 "House was running tactical simulations long before the world fell apart. Studying these can give is good insight into how to go about fighting our enemies out in the wasteland."

 veg_handh:0 "H&H Tools Grand Reopening"
 veg_handh_desc:0 "H&H Tools Factory was the Houses' family-owned company. Robert House's half-brother, Anthony House, cheated the inheritance of the company from Mr. House when their father died. Anthony House suffered from paranoia, which led to increasingly severe security measures at the company between 2020 and 2023 It's taken this long to get the doors open again."

 veg_zappsigns:0 "Zapp's Neon Signs"
 veg_zappsigns_desc:0 "Once a major sign manufacturing company, Zapp's Neon Signs once even lit up the Las Vegas strip itself.  Now they are more known for being used as impassable perimeter walls."

 veg_sewage:0 "Rebuild Vegas Sewage System"
 veg_sewage_desc:0 "Sewage is one of the lost commodities of the old world that only a handful of places can truly understand or appreciate, but soon enough everyone in New Vegas will know the joy that can be brought by such facilities."

 veg_fourthfam:0 "The Fourth Family"
 veg_fourthfam_desc:0 "The Mojave Brotherhood has never been on good terms with the people of New Vegas, but an alliance is an alliance, and it can't be denied that the King's work with them has brought many revelations to the people of Vegas."

 veg_elijah:0 "Elijah's Lucky 38 Restoration"
 veg_elijah_desc:0 "The Lucky 38 suffered a lot of damage during the war, taxing many of its systems to their limit when attempting to protect Las Vegas from nuclear oblivion. To this day, many of the lights and power systems haven't worked properly, but new efforts by Elijah have brought them back online."

 veg_t45d:0 "Brotherhood Research"
 veg_t45d_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel have seen it worthwhile to share with us the secret of their power armor. The King shall have his own company of Knights, with snazzy hair-doos and all the might in the world."

 veg_bossecurity:0 "New Vegas Security"
 veg_bossecurity_desc:0 "Over the decades, the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel has stolen dozens and dozens of Securitrons that they've found in the wasteland, deconstructing and repairing them for personal use. As a sign of good faith? A further exchange of such robots shall occur."

 veg_hopeville:0 "Reclaim the Old"
 veg_hopeville_desc:0 "Mr. House is aware of the existence of an extensive military network located between the township of Hopeville, and that the area has generally speaking, been used and occupied by assorted forces in the last few decades. Claiming it for himself will strengthen his control over the entrances to New Vegas."

 veg_ashton:0 "Strike the New"
 veg_ashton_desc:0 "Ashton stands in defiance to Mr. House, its people house refugees from the recent conquest of hopeville, and the majority of them resist what peace talks have been offered. Another lesson in strength will be needed to open this trade route once and for all."

 veg_newvegastreaty:0 "New Vegas Treaty"
 veg_newvegastreaty_desc:0 "The New California Republic continues to expand its borders rapidly, and New Vegas seems the next likely target. To prevent the brightest light of civilisation from being extinguished, I will offer them a deal they cannot refuse: McCarran Airport is theirs, as is a cut of the Dam's power, and New Vegas is left alone."

 veg_ncrtradedeal:0 "NCR Trade Deal"
 veg_ncrtradedeal_desc:0 "With New Vegas now out of the line of fire, talk of trade can begin. The Barons of the NCR are eager to milk New Vegas dry, to capitalise upon its wealth the way they did for Reno. But unlike the leaders of Reno, I know exactly how to use greedy fools to my advantage. New Vegas will thrive."

 veg_ncrstatehood:0 "NCR Statehood"
 veg_ncrstatehood_desc:0 "Statehood within the NCR might seem unappealing, but the corrupt nature of its inner workings give much room for autonomy. I spent my early life under the thumb of autocrafts and fools, I can do so again if it leads to my success."
