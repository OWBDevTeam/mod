 april.1.d:0 "Our technicians had finally unlocked the deepest depths of Area 51, where the most prized technology of all awaited us. Deep within that sprawling maze of corridors, hangars, and forgotten propulsion labs were numerous alien fighter craft. Boxes of unknown foreign objects were piled high beside these crafts; alien ship parts and artefacts that were unknowable to us. Many of the men began to scour through the piles for anything useful, weapons, fuel, something to use in the next raid. If only we'd never opened those doors in the first place. Somehow one of those psycho addicts must have set off some alien homing beacon. We didn't know at the time—but we do now. The night sky is bright with blue engine plumes and energy beams as they destroy our fighters one by one. Far, far above us, the blanket of stars is blocked out by some massive shadow in orbit."

If you\nlike news, then you're gonna love our next segment. An infamous\ngroup of raiders stationed in and around Area 51 have gone completely silent following a mysterious light show in the sky above their hideout. Onlookers reported blue geysers of energy streaking across the sky, followed by numerous explosions and distant screaming. At least one eyewitness report mentioned sightings of little green men. Whatever it was—I'd steer clear if I were you.  That was our top story. More classic music coming right up for you, so stay tuned."
