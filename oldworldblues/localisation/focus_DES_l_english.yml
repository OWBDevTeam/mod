 des_steel_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers have long wasted time and resources in the Sands of Nevada and Arizona, protecting the few while struggling to arm and supply themselves.

 des_vargas:0 "Snake Vargas"
 des_vargas_desc:0 "Despite a bad knee and an ageing mind, Snake Vargas has decided not to retire.

 des_tread:0 "Don't Tread On Me"
 des_tread_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers are a fiercely independent organization under Vargas, and one that has been defending their territory for innumerable years with little worry.

 des_population:0 "Tribal Integration"
 des_population_desc:0 "There are many small, secretive tribes located within Nevada, all of whom are in some way shape or another, helpful to our cause.

 des_pact:0 "The Nevada Pact"

 des_legionprep:0 "Preparing for the Legion"

 des_recruiter:0 "Appoint Head Recruiter"
 des_recruiter_desc:0 "It takes a special kind of person to talk a person into giving up everything they have to fight for the better of others. Charisma is important, but so is the ability to channel all of that anger someone might have at the world, and work it until it is a blaze."

 des_trader:0 "Appoint Head Trader"

 des_outreach:0 "Community Outreach"

 des_armouries:0 "Ranger Armoury"
 des_armouries_desc:0 "The Ranger Armoury is one of the best of its kind.

 des_mechanic:0 "Appoint Head Mechanic"
 des_mechanic_desc:0 "A good Greasemonkey can be hard to come by, but we've gotten lucky lately. An Outcast from the 80's Tribe have come south to offer their services to us. Maybe they want payback against their former gang, maybe they just want to help, but either way? It's a godsend."

 des_coop_desc:0 "We must work closely with the Rangers of the NCR if we are to triumph over the trials ahead. They are not unlike us, if a bit more militant when it comes down to core ideals. They shall be steadfast allies in the days to come."

 des_bunkers:0 "Breaking the Bunkers"
 des_bunkers_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel like to hide in their holes, fortified pre-war bunkers, and similar complexes. Getting into them is a nightmare, but someone has to do it. Constant drills and training have prepared us for such a task."

 des_jericho_desc:0 "Long ago, a fortress known as Jericho stood in defiance to the men and women of god. It was brought down by the wrath of god, and now? We shall invoke that same wrath against those who dared to strike at our allies in the NCR. If they will not stand with us against the Legion, they are against us."

 des_greatwar:0 "The Great War"
 des_greatwar_desc:0 "The Legion has come at last, and while even Hell Razor doubts that we can beat them, he rallies the men and women of the Desert Rangers for one last, great war. Some say he has a death wish, but he insists that he merely wants to instill in his men an understanding: there can be no victory without sacrifice."

 des_arizona:0 "Return to Arizona"
