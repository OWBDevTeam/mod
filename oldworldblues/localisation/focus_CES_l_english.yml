 ces_caesar_the_godslayer_desc: "Caesar will teach the Twin Mothers their final lesson. Their goddess is nothing more than an illusion - and can be slain. With their tribe broken and enslaved, they will be chained to Caesar's will - and used as healers for the Legion."

 ces_the_brotherhood_of_steel: "The Brotherhood of Steel"
 ces_the_brotherhood_of_steel_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel are a backwards, insane tribe. They're the worst of humanity, hoarders - scavengers dressed in trappings of chivalry. They offer no future; they are a dead end."

 ces_the_last_knight: "The Last Knight"
 ces_the_last_knight_desc: "One member of the Brotherhood in particular resisted us for a long time, until we managed to capture and commit him to the gladiator arena. Though we had hoped he would meet his death in the arena, he has fought valiantly against everything we throw at him."

 ces_deconstructing_perfection: "Deconstructing Perfection"

 ces_crossing_the_rubicon: "Crossing The Rubicon"
 ces_crossing_the_rubicon_desc: "Caesar's ancient namesake once crossed a river named the Rubicon, an unprecedented move that pitted him against Rome so that he could usurp it as Emperor. Similarly, our Legion crossing the Colorado River signifies total war."

 ces_war_for_hoover_dam: "War For Hoover Dam"
 ces_war_for_hoover_dam_desc: "The Dam is our only way into Nevada, into the Mojave - where our Rome lies, New Vegas. The Dam is also a spectacular prize, but all of this has been claimed by the Bear. We must go to war with the NCR to claim the Dam back."

 ces_the_burned_man: "The Burned Man"

 ces_fortify_the_dam: "Fortify The Dam"
 ces_fortify_the_dam_desc: "Hoover Dam is naturally a heavily fortified location - but as such an important strategic location, we can afford to be over-cautious. Increasing the legionary garrison there, and constructing fortified towers - will make it harder to besiege."

 ces_fortification_hill: "The Fort"
 ces_fortification_hill_desc: "Fortification Hill, just before the Dam, is a prime location to begin the rebuilding of forces to retake the Dam. We should construct a camp there, to train new legionaries and command from."

 # Mexico sub-tree
 ces_mexico_expansion: "Mexican Expansion"
 ces_mexico_expansion_desc: "South of Caesar's territory is the land of Mexico. It is a prime point of expansion, with many weak tribes and nations. Should the Legion's army find themselves in Mexico, their conquest would be easy."

 ces_the_eternal_city: "The Eternal City"

 ces_caesers_palace: "Caesar's Palace"
 ces_caesers_palace_desc: "Deep in the ruined parts of the Strip, a casino called 'Caesar's Palace' has been unearthed. It seems it was almost destiny for the Legion to take the Strip, and discover this palace. Caesar has taken the casino as his seat of power, and begun reconstruction efforts."

 ces_open_the_lucky_38: "Break The Bank"
 ces_open_the_lucky_38_desc: "The Lucky 38 stands tall, watching over the Strip. Inside, Mr House must have housed many treasures and, as it has not been opened since before the war, much pre-war technology."

 ces_expand_the_via_militaris_desc: "With our conquests in the Mojave won, and our frontier pushed to Vegas - the Via Militaris should be expanded into the Strip, for easier access for our soldiers."

 ces_mccarran_airstrip: "McCarran Airstrip"
 ces_mccarran_airstrip_desc: "Outside Freeside is the McCarran Airstrip, seized from the NCR after Vegas was conquered. With some work put in, this could be the base of a Legionary Air Force."

 ces_scouring_the_strip: "Scourging The Strip"
 ces_scouring_the_strip_desc: "The Strip was once used by the NCR to improve morale by its soldiers. Such decadence and debauchery is uncharacteristic of a proper military force, so we will scourge the Strip, and use it to arm our soldiers."

 ces_nova_roma: "Nova Roma"

 ces_a_worthy_foe: "A Worthy Foe"
 ces_a_worthy_foe_desc: "For the first time, the Legion has encountered a foe perhaps more powerful than itself, and the first foe that Caesar is ideologically opposed to. The NCR is, indeed, a worthy foe for Caesar's fledgling Legion."

 ces_divide_et_impera: "Divide Et Impera"
 ces_divide_et_impera_desc: "Divide Et Impera, or 'divide and conquer' - is the principle of dividing a larger power into smaller powers, in order to better conquer or rule over the parts. By attacking key areas of the NCR, we can weaken them enough to be more easily conquered."

 ces_battle_of_nelson: "Battle Of Nelson"
 ces_battle_of_nelson_desc: "The town of Nelson, though only small, could prove an extremely important strategic point to launch assaults on the NCR in Mojave. By expending some manpower to take it, we can seize the town as a base across the Colorado."

 ces_in_hoc_signo_taurus_vinces: "In Hoc Signo Taurus Vinces"
 ces_in_hoc_signo_taurus_vinces_desc: "In the sign of the bull, we shall conquer. The NCR will fall beneath the might of the Legion, and its lands will be conquered. All preparations have been made, and it is time to declare war."

 ces_spqr: "S.P.Q.R."
 ces_spqr_desc: "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Vulpes Inculta emerged victorious. This move will likely mean the Legion becoming less of a militarised force, but Vulpes Inculta has many strengths of his own."

 ces_legion_salvagers: "Legion Salvagers"
 ces_legion_salvagers_desc: "Dog City is a remarkable place, filled to the brim with relics untouched by fearful tribals, or protected by packs of savage hounds who have been and bred here for over a hundred years.

 ces_the_capital_desc: "Flagstaff is the heart and soul of the Legion. It was the first city conquered by Caesar, and it is the place to which all trade in the Four States region flows. Let us grow its reputation, let it be a city to rival any in the NCR!"

 ces_flagstaff_fort: "Flagstaff Fortress"
 ces_flagstaff_fort_desc: "The Legion is a machine, it takes in weak things and spits out mighty things. Boys become men, men become soldiers, soldiers become heroes, heroes become legends. But before this can happen? Our Legionaries will require weapons."

 ces_slaves_to_flagstaff_desc: "From all across the Four States, and beyond, the come to us. Shackled and bound, broken in spirit and mind. We shall give them purpose again, they shall work for the greatest force in the wasteland, or they shall die trying to resist it."

What better place for a Legion outpost than a den of wickedness?"

 ces_slaves_in_phoenix: "Slaves in Phoenix"
 ces_slaves_in_phoenix_desc: "All things are traded in Phoenix, among them slaves. Brought inland from slavers in both Baja, and further south in Mexico, these people do not speak our language, yet they work with the will of people who desire to one day return home.

 ces_enslave_tribals: "Enslave Tribals"
 ces_enslave_tribals_desc: "The people of Two Sun are relatively safe from Legionary conscription, yet the tribals who were under their protection are ours to claim now. The Tombwalkers, the Sun Hunters, and the Roadrunners shall be absorbed into the legion, and form the heart of a new cohort."

 ces_fort_construction: "Fort Construction"
