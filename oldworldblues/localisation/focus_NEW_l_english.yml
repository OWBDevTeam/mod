 new_littlecity_desc:0 "Before the atomic fire rained from on high? Reno was the biggest little city in the world! But now? Now it might just be the biggest city in the wasteland. To this day, the works and structures that survived the end of the world benefit us."

 new_thefamily:0 "Calling in the Family"
 new_thefamily_desc:0 "Of all the crime 'families' of Reno, ours is the only true family by blood. Reno is a decrepit sinkhole, and it swallowed one of our own whole. Though we were considered the weakest of the families, under our leadership Reno will prosper, and most importantly, be purified."

 new_church:0 "Evangelical Church of New Reno"
 new_church_desc:0 "Constructing churches and schools across Reno would go a long way towards our dream of an idealistic town, no longer a city full of the worst scum of the Wasteland. Dismantling some of the old families' casinos for our churches is also a fitting metaphor for our future."

 new_speakeasies:0 "Reno Speakeasies"
 new_speakeasies_desc:0 "Even the temperate people of our utopian New Reno need a place to relax. Secret trade in alcohol was Orville Wright's trade and led to our prominence as a family, so it only makes sense to build speakeasies across Reno for safe, responsible entertainment."

 new_police:0 "New Reno Police Department"
 new_police_desc:0 "The sinful wasters of Reno haven't taken to our rule well, but through a contact of Christopher Wrights, we have a foolproof plan. A police department made up of FEV-enhanced superhumans would certainly be able to enforce law and order, even in Reno."

 new_criminalworld:0 "Small Time Crime in the Wasteland"
 new_criminalworld_desc:0 "Not everything that happens in Reno happens because the men and women on top want it to. It's a free thinking place filled with entrepreneurs who are willing to do just about anything for a handful of caps."

 new_expansionism:0 "Expansionism"
 new_expansionism_desc:0 "Sure, Reno's the biggest little city in the world, but why confine ourselves to a little city? We're a big power in the wastes, and its time that was recognized. Why not expand our borders a little?"

 new_savages:0 "Culling the Savages"

 new_slavery:0 "Large Scale Slavery"

 new_salvatores_desc:0 "One of the smaller families, we Salvatores bore our time, and with great patience and cunning plotted our way into power.

 new_whitepawn:0 "White Pawn to E4"
 new_whitepawn_desc:0 "The families of Reno all lack vision. All but us, the Bishops. Unlike the other families, who only look for profit, we desire real power and an alliance with the NCR or Vault City is the way to achieve this."

 new_bishop:0 "Bishop to Bc4"
 new_bishop_desc:0 "The patriarch of our family is also one of our greatest assets. Mr Bishop, whose questionable lineage has no doubt given him a penance for exploration and a familiarity with the harsh wastes of Nevada. Through his frequent wanders, he has learned to lead troops through the desert."

 new_f3_desc:0 "To consolidate our rule over Reno, we will forge an alliance with the Van Graffs - whose ruthlessness and superior tech make them the perfect ally to remove our enemies. Mr Bishop is set to marry into the Van Graffs through their matriarch, Tiaret, in return for their aid."

 new_queen_desc:0 "On our behalf, the Van Graffs will eliminate the Wright family, who they have had a rivalry with for some time. Though the pragmatic Mr Bishop doesn't want to hear of the details, Tiaret Van Graff assures it will be brutal. Checkmate."

 new_mordinos_desc:0 "Our family, the Mordinos, was once the most powerful family of Reno, and our tributaries still hold much sway in Reno's dealings. We desire a return to Reno's golden age, where debauchery and addiction swept Nevada."

 new_addictionempire:0 "Addiction Empire"

 new_myron:0 "Myron's Legacy"
 new_myron_desc:0 "Myron was the genius who first developed Jet, after he found that peyote resulted in a longer high and wasn't nearly as addictive. His legacy is the highly addictive, high turnaround super-drug of Jet, which made the Mordinos very rich."

 new_jetbeta:0 "Jet Beta"
 new_jetbeta_desc:0 "Finally, the key to our rule over Reno has been completed. The Beta version of Jet, much more addictive and fully immune to a cure is now finished, and by pumping this out we'll make the whole Wasteland addicts, truly forming our Addiction Empire."

 new_allroads:0 "All Roads Lead to Reno"

 new_expansion:0 "Van Graff Expansion"
 new_expansion_desc:0 "Allowing the Van Graff family to expand their operations in energy weapon dealing would bring in even more money. In a dangerous place like New Reno, people deserve a little protection."

 new_precautions:0 "Precautions"
 new_precautions_desc:0 "Precautions must be taken in Reno to protect our assets. It is not enough to rely on the peace of our neighbours in such a place as the Wasteland. A great wall must be constructed around New Reno."

 new_radio:0 "New Reno Radio"
 new_radio_desc:0 "Construction radio towers across Reno would be useful both for entertainment, as we can broadcast music, but also as a way of subterfuge and communicating with out mobsters and other armies."

 new_sweatshop:0 "Sweatshop Labour"
 new_sweatshop_desc:0 "The ends justify the means, and sweatshop labour is ultimately extremely efficient. These are wasters and junkies who would die on the streets, at least this way they are employed."

 new_farmsteads:0 "Modoc Farmsteads"
 new_farmsteads_desc:0 "The farmsteads of Modoc are a great source of food for the people of Reno. Investing in their expansion could lead to a higher population in the city as more people prosper and stay fed."

 new_airport:0 "Old Reno Airport"

 new_golgotha:0 "Golgotha Restoration"
 new_golgotha_desc:0 "Golgotha is the graveyard outside of Reno, where the dead were buried and the enemies of certain families were sent to be disposed of. Restoring Golgotha to its original purpose would remove the enemies of mobster families much more discreetly."

 new_techslot:0 "Sierra Depot Excavation"
 new_techslot_desc:0 "Converting the Sierra Depot looting to a full scale excavation would take some manpower, but ultimately the pre-War secrets of the army base are too valuable to ignore. We could gleam much insight from the Depot."

 new_mercmilitary:0 "Merc Military"
 new_mercmilitary_desc:0 "Reno has no standing fighting force, unless you consider the mobsters of the individual families. Instead, they must rely on mercenaries as their armies. The vast wealth of Reno means their merc's contracts last very long, however."

 new_uniques:0 "Unique Mercenaries"
 new_uniques_desc:0 "The leaders of the Reno families have their own special contacts in the mercenary world, and some mercenary armies are more disposed to offer contracts to them. These unique mercenaries often tailor to the specific 'needs' of their families' leader."

 new_roaring_desc:0 "The Roaring Bears are ex-NCR military who found that their specialized skills could find them more wealth in the mercenary world than as NCR conscripts. Strongly disciplined and skilled in motorized warfare, the Roaring Bears are a good stand in for a standing army."

 new_artillery:0 "The Hell-Hammers"
 new_artillery_desc:0 "The Hell-Hammers are a crazy, but rigidly organized band of men obsessed with armaments. Extremely skilled in artillery and heavy weaponry, they are quite possibly the greatest line of defence any city could ask for."

 new_thradd:0 "Thradd's Immortals"
 new_thradd_desc:0 "Lead by Thradd the Immortal, a cunning ex-leader in the Master's Army, the Immortals are a band of Super Mutant mercenaries. Undoubtedly one of the most formidable and infamous forces available for hire in the Wasteland, their allegiance is dubious."

 new_granite:0 "Sgt. Granite's Defence Company"

 new_gladiators:0 "Junk City Gladiators"
 new_gladiators_desc:0 "The Junk City Gladiators are a mercenary army made up entirely of robots, led by an 'erratic', to say the least, captain named Pit Master Frazz. They would be very useful as heavy support."

 new_roadpsychos:0 "Road Psychos"

 new_stash:0 "The Old Stash"
 new_stash_desc:0 "Our Allies in the Enclave luckily left us a large stash of energy weapons we have unearthed, allowing us to equip our mobsters with weapons far more advanced than our contemporaries, the exact biting edge we need to hold Reno."

 new_bloodynight:0 "The Bloody Night"
 new_bloodynight_desc:0 "Utilizing the weaponry of the Enclave, our mobsters will lead a great campaign against the other families of Reno, gaining complete and utter control for us. Our conquest is sure to be bloody, but we will emerge victorious."

 new_hedge:0 "Hedged Bets"
 new_hedge_desc:0 "Fortifying the ex-Yakuza territory should be a good enough disincentive for any more raider groups to take refuge in the area. Also, with potential enemies growing in the South and West, it is never bad to hedge your bets."

 new_hordes:0 "Hordes of the North"
 new_hordes_desc:0 "North of Nevada is a cold and barren territory, full of savages and distant powerful threats. With the Antelope Reservation under our control, it is now our first line of defence against the Northern Hordes."

 new_klamathdeal:0 "The Klamath Deal"
 new_klamathdeal_desc:0 "Klamath is a small town to the north that, while not a threat to us, could be a decent enough asset, or even, ally. We should strike a trade deal with this small town, and perhaps open up greater relations."

 new_takedown:0 "Taking Down the Den"
 new_takedown_desc:0 "The people of Klamath are after all, quite primitive, and their town might be better served under others rule. It would be a great asset for New Reno to acquire after all."

 new_debtwarriors:0 "Debt Warriors"
