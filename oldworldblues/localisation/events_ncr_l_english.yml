 ncr-boswar.1.t:0 "NCR Patrol Report"
 ncr-boswar.1.d:0 "Recently an NCR patrol found a large group of Brotherhood soldiers and scribes inhabiting a building in the heart of the Boneyard. Attempts to figure out what they're doing have been fruitless. When asked to leave, they declined - violently. Already a few NCR soldiers have died for "trespassing", and we're reaching a breaking point."

 ncr-boswar.2.t:0 "NCR Messenger"
 ncr-boswar.2.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning a man approached the sealed doors of one of our bunkers near NCR territory. He claims to be a messenger sent by the Californian brass, and so we took his message and told him to await our reply. The NCR are accusing us of sending a Brotherhood patrol to the Boneyard, without their permission. They made it especially clear that the patrol has already killed many NCR soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.2.a:0 "Tell them they were acting without orders"
 ncr-boswar.2.b:0 "Tell the NCR to return our men"
 
 ncr-boswar.3.t:0 "Scene Of Battle"
 ncr-boswar.3.d:0 "A month ago a large group of our soldiers went missing with a small contingent of Scribes. After much searching we finally found them thanks to a distress signal. We arrived at the scene of a bloody battle, with laser burns and bullet holes across the entire building. We searched the ruin for any signs of technology, or survivors, and found nothing... nothing except a few pairs of NCR dogtags lost under the rubble."

 ncr-boswar.3.b:0 "We don't want to poke the bear"
 
 ncr-boswar.4.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.4.d:0 "Our messenger has come back to us shaken, but unharmed. The message he carries from the Brotherhood is blunt and to the point. "Our soldiers were acting without orders, they must have gone AWOL over something important." Whether we believe them or not, one thing is certain: the Brotherhood soldiers we found were in a West-Tek facility."

 ncr-boswar.5.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson was reaching a breaking point, but one of the senators, a man by the name of Sean All-Good Murphy stepped in to calm the President."
 ncr-boswar.5.a:0 "Send him to the Brotherhood"
 
 ncr-boswar.6.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.6.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson crushed the message in the ball of his fist in rage. The audacity!"
 ncr-boswar.6.a:0 "Mobilise the army!"
 
 ncr-boswar.7.t:0 "Scouting Party Returns"
 ncr-boswar.7.d:0 "We've received word from our AWOL soldiers that the NCR allowed them to leave the Boneyard without complications. Supposedly they're bringing some seven holotapes of unknown value back with them; but since they're from a West-Tek facility they will be invaluable to our efforts to understand and preserve technology."
 ncr.boswar.7.a:0 "Punish them for acting without orders"
 
 ncr-boswar.8.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 ncr-boswar.8.d:0 "We've been given an ultimatum by the NCR. Either we give them compensation for the deaths of their soldiers, or there will be "repercussions". "
 ncr-boswar.8.a:0 "Pay the compensation"
 ncr-boswar.8.b:0 "Compensation? For what?"
 
 ncr-boswar.9.t:0 "All-Good Returns"
 ncr-boswar.9.d:0 "Our demands have not gone unnoticed. The NCR have sent All-Good to speak with us once again. As ever he came to us nervous but undaunted, and we began to discuss the current situation. Sean stresses that he was only barely able to keep the NCR from declaring all-out war for our "hubris" and seeks to find a compromise. "
 ncr-boswar.9.a:0 "We must find a peaceful solution"
 ncr-boswar.9.b:0 "We must have our men returned"
 
 ncr-boswar.10.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.10.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson flew into a fit of fury, but a senator by the name of Sean Murphy stepped forward to calm him. This man, "All-Good", proposed simply letting the soldiers go. He knows the Brotherhood, and made a convincing argument that open conflict would put the NCR through a gauntlet it could entirely avoid."
 ncr-boswar.10.a:0 "We can't risk a war"
 
 ncr-boswar.11.t:0 "Brotherhood Refusal"
 ncr-boswar.11.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson is outraged at the continued audacity of the Brotherhood, and nobody steps forward to offer any kind of alternatives."
 ncr-boswar.11.a:0 "To hell with diplomacy!"
 
 ncr-boswar.12.t:0 "Successful Mission"
 ncr-boswar.12.d:0 "All-Good returned from the Brotherhood optimistically. They're willing to find a compromise to the issue as long as it's reasonable, and Sean is telling us to take them up on this offer. He suggests we ask the Brotherhood to detain their soldiers who killed our soldiers, for a number of years they find reasonable, and they can keep the rest. All we need, he says, is justice for our dead soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.12.a:0 "Hopefully the Brotherhood keep their end"
 ncr-boswar.12.b:0 "No repercussions? To hell with that!"
 
 ncr-boswar.13.t:0 "Diplomacy Wins Out"
 ncr-boswar.13.d:0 "We've received word that the Brotherhood have sentenced the soldiers responsible for killing our men. Five years for one man, and two for the other three. The Brotherhood have sent a formal thank you to us for allowing them to carry out the sentence."
 ncr-boswar.13.a:0 "The sentences are too short, but at least we avoided more bloodshed"
 
 ncr-boswar.14.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
 ncr-boswar.14.d:0 "Negotiations have broken down with the NCR. All-Good sent us a message ahead of time informing us of the worst, and the Elders are demanding the NCR be silenced once and for all."

 nf_ncr.1.t:0 "The Beloved Of The Republic"
 nf_ncr.1.d:0 "Among the historical records of the NCR, there are a number of figures that stand out as quintessential to the republic, yet who among them is most celebrated in propaganda and education? Who shall appear on the most important pieces of currency, be mentioned in speeches, and stand above the rest as the figurehead of the NCR? The three essential figures in the history of the NCR are thus: "
 nf_ncr.1.a:0 "Aradesh, the founder and father of the NCR."

 nf_ncr.1.c:0 "Tandi, Mother of the Republic."
 
 nf_ncr.2.t:0 "~The Baja Blues~"
 nf_ncr.2.d:0 " In the year 2256, the NCR Colony of Rattletail was established in the northern portion of Baja California by some volunteer colonists, who advanced with formal funding and merit from the NCR, but with little to no supervision or military protection. This choice would prove almost fatal for the young colonists, who elected to, by force, take control over the primary water source in the region, a fact that they were ignorant to at the time. \n\n   The locals retaliated against the small settlement, due in part to desperation, and launched two major assaults against the township, both of which were stopped with relative ease. It was the intervention and wisdom of a young Ranger, named Hanlon, that ended the dispute before the toll of the conflict became notable. The man crafted a clever lie, spouting nonsense about an arm of raiders that would soon come and wipe the down away. The colonists evacuated, the locals regained their water-supply, and greater conflict was avoided. \n\n   Unfortunately, this lie had an unintended result. It implanted, in the locals, the notion that the NCR was afraid of raiders, slavers, and the other violent sort. The locals of Baja have had almost a decade to prepare for the return of the NCR, and in preparation for that coming, they have adopted a violent, cruel lifestyle. Baja is now home to an up and coming Mexican Cartel, one that will be almost impossible to dislodge without violence. The path into the future is a complicated one, and there are only a handful of men in the NCR who have the potential to deal with this problem. Who do you appoint to oversee the handling of Baja the Baja Frontier?"
 nf_ncr.2.a:0 "Ranger Chief Hanlon, the Heavy Hand."
 nf_ncr.2.b:0 "Héctor Santángel, the Local Sympathizer."
 nf_ncr.2.c:0 "Grant C. Hayes, the Mayor of Dayglow."
 
 nf_ncr.3.t:0 "~The Baron's War!~"
 nf_ncr.3.d:0 "  There is no misunderstanding within the NCR as to which border is the weakest, for the northern lands of the NCR haven't seen large-scale military action or involvement since the NCR-80's War, almost ten years ago. It was during this time that many vulnerabilities within the NCR became clear, not the least of which was the substantial time it can take for the NCR to mobilize and move its military north. \n\n  When faced with the realization that the NCR's military was largely incapable of protecting or patrolling the rural northern reaches of the nation, the many influential and wealthy Brahmin Baron's took to protecting their own property with private military forces. Dozens and sometimes hundreds of mercenaries, being paid to patrol acres of grazing land, and to fight off rustlers. While initially harmless, the situation has grown more dangerous in recent years, as Baron's have taken to engaging in endless skirmishes with one another for land Brahmin, while using their political clout to keep local law enforcement off their backs. \n\n  And yet something has happened that no amount of clout can hide. The Poker family, a group of Baron's past their prime, openly murdered their prime rivals on the streets of Sacramento in a gunfight involving no fewer than fifty men and resulted in numerous civilian casualties. This event ignited a powder keg of infight among the Baron's, who now sent thousands of mercenaries to raid each other's holdings in the countryside and in various towns. Dozens of civilians have died, and an unprecedented amount of property damage has been dealt. What's more, the flow of food to the densely populated urban regions of the NCR has all but stopped. This is a disaster that must be brought under control before starvation sets in."
 nf_ncr.3.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 
 nf_ncr.4.t:0 "The Emergency Council."
 nf_ncr.4.d:0 "The situation in the north has thrown the entire NCR into chaos, and dozens are dying each day. There is only so much that can be done on short notice, and even as troops are being shipped north. In an attempt to bring an end to the chaos, many powerful NCR politicians and military commanders have formed an emergency council to handle the situation. Yet even now the council has fallen to infighting, with the two most powerful political figures present, Anton I. Flynn and Sean "Allgood" Murphy clashing during every encounter. Flynn believes that the easiest method of dealing with the situation is to simply hire the mercenaries employed by all Baron's and to redistribute the land of the more violent Barons to loyal ones, such as himself. Murphy, however, believes that this is simply a power play on Flynn's part, and thinks the answer lies with outside help. Namely, the Brotherhood of Steel, who used to patrol and protect the region. The Military commanders present aren't fond of either plan and even now, consider ignoring the council to take decisive action."

To this end, he has spent much of his first year in office drumming up support for the ambitions Mojave Expedition, which is meant to bring as much of southern Nevada and California under the NCR's control as possible. Yet in order to make such a dream a reality, he is going to have too deal with various political parties. Each pushes their own agenda, and each wants to put their own figurehead in the most ambitious post in the NCR's military. Yet it is only with this support that Peterson can gain the congressional votes he needs to launch the Expedition."

 nf_ncr.8.d:0 "The Efforts of Grant C.

The various gangs are at our tables, offering to both disarm and unify under the umbrella of the NCR, in exchange for further funding and most importantly, the ability to gain protection from the central government of the NCR. All is well and the integration act seems to be going as planned! Yet the peace talks are… delicate, and it would take only the smallest offense to push the gangs of Baja back into violence. Yet who would want that?"

The debate raged for months as to whether or not to even bother with this plan, but eventually it was decided that the bill should focus on the development of a specific area of the economy. Be it the reconstruction of roads, subsidising select local businesses, or additional funding towards arms manufacturing."

Tandi made it clear to him that the NCR could not afford a slaughter, and advised him to hold back the majority of his troops during the assault. Meanwhile, the commander of the Brotherhood of Steel had already gone and approved Plans with Drummund, a joint attack that was dependant on the NCR providing a sizeable distraction. All the while, Drummund had grown increasingly frustrated with the entire situation and knew that he might regain much of his lost honor if he ordered an overwhelming charge, and claimed the majority of Navarro's treasures for the NCR, a reckless move that could save his career."

The cumulative tests such as the Legion and Brotherhood of Steel have aroused a staunch anti-war stance from many of the NCR’s states, which has in turn damaged trust in the central government of the republic and its military. The Brahmin Baron’s, who have flocked to the side of presidential candidate Anton Flynn, squabble for power after their recent disasters. Meanwhile, Allgood Murphy Preaches fire and Brimstone against the Warlike Aaron Kimball, going so far as to threaten bringing the Brotherhood of Steel into any potential conflict. Meanwhile, the charismatic Grant C. Hayes has corned the vote in the state of Dayglow, and his shadowy allies begin to make their move all across the republic.

Even now, his forces advance, be they Enclave soldiers in power armor, or former NCR personnel who have flocked to his cause. \n\n   In an attempt to counter these developments, Aaron Kimball has declared himself the de-facto president of the NCR, something that is unanimous by his supporters in Shady Sands and the military. However, this action has alienated the people of the Boneyard, who have decried the military's takeover of the republic, and the avoidance of democracy in the matter. Outraged by the situation, and hoping to avoid getting caught up in the war between Kimball and Hayes, Allgood Murphy and his supporters have declared an independent Boneyard, with many of the surrounding communities flocking to the banner of his new republic. Aaron Kimball has, understandably, labeled Allgood and his followers' enemies of the republic, and called for his arrest, even as Hayes prepares to push both Allgood and Kimball out with his growing warmachine.\n\n   Allgood Murphy is not the only individual who has chosen to stand against the sudden ascension of Aaron Kimball and his military regime. Anton Flynn has elected to succeed from the nation, due in no small part to his belief that neither of his counterparts stands a chance in hell against the encroaching forces of Hayes.

 ncr_tribe_rebellion_news.1.d:0 "Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to me, Mr. New Vegas, and you look extraordinarily beautiful right now. I've got news for you. After a tense series of negotiations, the NCR has finally agreed to pull their troops out of the territories formerly occupied by the Legion. Many are heralding this as the return of democracy to the area, as NCR officials will be turning over key facilities to local govnerments before their departure. That's all for now, folks. More classics coming right up for you, so stay tuned."

The NCR has been under heavy criticism today after they prematurely ended negotiations with the representatives of fledgling nations occupying the former Legion territories, citing the ineligability of the gathered nations to govern themselves. Radio New Vegas reached out to the NCR Embassy in New Vegas but they declined to comment on the matter. For better or for worse, it seems that the Three-State-Area will remain under the NCR's control. That's the news. Ladies and Gentlemen, this next song goes out from me to you."

It's just about time to get you some news. The self proclaimed \"Phoenix Republic\" has declared war on the NCR, leading a small independence faction with both the Twisted Hairs and the former Legion capital of Flagstaff as member nations.

If you like news, then you're gonna love our next segment. The situation continues to worsen for the NCR as territories north of the former Legion capital rise in open rebellion, joining the Phoenix Republic. One of these territories, governed by the Blackfoot tribe, is lead by a former frontline Legion commander. I guess old habits die hard. That's it for now, but we'll keep you up to date.

More troubling news coming from beyond the Colorado today, as the formerly occupied nation of Two Sun joins forces with the rebels, alongside numerous smaller groups. Two Sun best known for being a hub of Desert Ranger activity before their journey to Nevada, was one of the Legion's most recent conquests. The NCR's annexation of Two Sun comes as a surprise, given their condemnation of the Legion's expansion into the area during their campaign. The NCR Embassy declined to comment. That was the news. And now, I'd like to play one of my very favorite songs for you."

The NCR's occupation of the Three-State-Area collapsed today as the Legipn's most powerful trade hub, the Red Sun Republic, declared its support for the rebellion. Alongside numerous other newcomers, the Republic launched an assault on numerous NCR garrisons in the area, killing many. Slim, the President of the Republic and former mayor of Red Sun City, was infamous within the Legion for successfully opposing their attempts to enslave portions of the city's population.

Well known for being the Legion's \"border town\", Fort Summers is famous for its high presence of quote undesirables.

This morning the last of the remaining occupied territories rose up against the NCR. The Hangdogs, the Legion's most difficult conquest in history, is one of the nations joining the rebellion. Feared for their vicious dogs and advanced group tactics, the Hangdogs slaughtered what little remained of the NCR in their territory. With the absorbtion of the entirity of the Three-State-Area, the Phoenix Republic has become a superpower within a week—something which took the NCR decades.
