 brk_coastal_terror:0 "Coastal Terror"
 brk_coastal_terror_desc:0 "Our ships can reach anywhere! Experienced sailors are common in the coast, which comes in handy when a lot of loot is waiting to be taken from distant lands, or ships carrying goods need to be persued and plundered."

 brk_raider_society:0 "Society of Raiders"
 brk_raider_society_desc:0 "Loot is a strong drive for the inhabitants of the Broken Coast, many of the hardened raiders from all over come together to seek their fortunes in combat. These raiders are born and raised in the frigid mountains, and bathed in the icy wind of the sea making them extremely resistant to the cold. That being said, all that time spent focused on raiding makes innovation... a bit of a lower priority."

 brk_resistance_pact_signatory_desc:0 "The Broken Coast's unchallenged aggression must no longer stand, we shall find volunteers to form resistance units and embed in countries threatened by the savagery of the Broken Coast. To these volunteers we shall provide some war material and transport. In exchange if we are to be threatened, units from other signatories will embed within our borders and help us in the defence of our homeland."
