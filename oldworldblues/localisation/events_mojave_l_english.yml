 nf_mojave.1.t:0 "Chapter Leadership"
 nf_mojave.1.d:0 "The question of who should ultimately lead the Mojave Brotherhood is one that has come up many a time before. Head Paladin McNamara has his doubts about Elijah's search for technology, worried that controlling Helios One will make them an opportune target for the great powers of the wasteland. An emergency meeting is called, with McNamara and Elijah leading the discussion. The meeting quickly descends into heated arguments and threats, culminating in Paladin Hardin and a few of his men drawing their weapons and threatening to kill Elder Elijah. Wanting to avoid unnecessary bloodshed, McNamara launches into an emboldened speech about brotherhood and loyalty."
 nf_mojave.1.a:0 "Elijah stays in charge."
 nf_mojave.1.c:0 "Hardin takes control."
 nf_mojave.1.b:0 "MacNamara ousts Elijah."

 nf_mojave.2.t:0 "Rumours of the Old World"
 nf_mojave.2.d:0 "Common knowledge dictates that the elders of any given society hold the largest wealth of knowledge, and that was truest within the Brotherhood of Steel. Father Elijah had learned a great many things as his life ticked away year after year, and as his youth left him it was replaced with a ravenous desire to reach the unreachable. He had an incurable and deadly disease that had sent many a fool to an early death: Old World Blues. But unlike his peers, Elijah possessed the skills to make his obsession a reality. Two places captivated him with their alluring glow of the bygone era of mankind. Helios One and the Sierra Madre. The former was in his new backyard, within throwing distance of the headquarters of his newly established chapter. Abandoned and unattended for an unknowable amount of time, the seemingly benign solar power plant held a dark secret. Elijah had a hunch that there was more to this place than power generation, and he was determined to lay its secrets bare. His second obsession was a much deeper, more insidious love. He'd heard tales of a forlorn desert jewel: the Sierra Madre. It was a place said to contain riches beyond your imagination, where any wish could be granted. Whether or not he believed these prospector's tales, he knew that the casino and resort was using rare prototype technology. It had its dangers, he was sure, but if he could find it he would crack it open as simply as any safe. As far as Elijah was concerned, nothing was sacred: everything was his to know."
 nf_mojave.2.a:0 "Nothing is sacred."

 nf_mojave.3.t:0 "A Forgotten Hellscape"
 nf_mojave.3.d:0 "Blood pooled under a red sun as the sound of creaking metal echoed throughout the villa like a distorted scream. One of the knights looked down at his chest, only to see a ghastly arm protruding from it, wriggling around in the air as if it were trying to grasp more flesh. Twitching violently, it pulled back with supernatural force, and the knight fell to the ground as he vomited blood inside his own helmet. Elijah was forced to watch in horror, him and his surviving followers faced by a creature unlike any other. It stood there, hunched over its kill with arms wide and reaching for the dead man. Suddenly, it twitched in place, letting out a terrible screech and chitter as it turned to face the group. Clad from head to toe in some kind of hazmat suit, its face was nothing more than a gas mask. Its visors glowed a deep green, like haunted jade, and its green breath streamed out of the filter in waves like smoke. The Sierra Madre was not a forgotten dream, or a paradise waiting to be discovered: it was Hell on Earth."
 nf_mojave.3.a:0 "We must continue"

 nf_mojave.4.t:0 "Close Down Van Graffs"
 nf_mojave.4.d:0 "Brotherhood scouts had reported that a group was establishing itself in the Mojave as a distributor of Pre-War weapons. Upon further investigation they turned out to be part of the Van Graff family. Lowlifes like the Van Graffs didn't phase Hardin in the slightest. Their family was a massive organised crime syndicate operating out of Redding in the NCR, and was partly responsible for the NCR's weak expansion north. In Hardin's eyes, it was time they reminded the Mojave that the Brotherhood was still a force to be reckoned with. Their guard stationed outside proved easy enough to deal with. The Brotherhood didn't need to worry about stealth, the moment they turned the corner and saw him standing there, they simply opened fire. The pile of ash and bloody body parts that was left didn't stop them from kicking down the door moments later. As the traders reached for their weapons, the Brotherhood poured into the building as a few of them stood at the sides and fired at the remaining guards. Charging forwards into the building with his men, Hardin launched himself at a guard reaching for a plasma pistol, tackling him into the wall with a loud crack. A few minutes later and the Silver Rush was silent save for the sound of servos moving. Hardin's men began to strip the shop of its valuables, taking everything they could get their hands on. Energy weapons, ammo, armour, salvage: all of it was theirs. A crowd that had formed outside the casino dispersed when the Brotherhood began to leave, with a few of the Kings trailing them until they left Freeside for good. Everybody felt it: the Brotherhood were back."
 nf_mojave.4.a:0 "The Van Graffs have been dealt with"

 nf_mojave.5.t:0 "NCR Raids"
 nf_mojave.5.d:0 "Brotherhood influence in the Mojave has been waning ever since the NCR began to dedicate more manpower to the area. The NCR is more capable of reinforcing their troops, able to rely on their large supply lines to feed their army. However, they walk a fine line, as supplies stretch thin the deeper into the Mojave they go. Hardin recognised this, and organised a series of raids on NCR bases to disrupt their supply lines. Mojave Outpost was the first to be struck by the Brotherhood. Focusing on causing as much damage to infrastructure as possible, they collapsed one of the buildings in the middle of the battle, in an attempt to hamper NCR reconstruction efforts. The fighting was intense, the mass of troopers moving through the outpost made it difficult to raid, but in the end the Brotherhood left triumphant. Following their success at Mojave Outpost, the Brotherhood moved on to their second target: Camp Golf. Stopping briefly to rest, repair, and heal up at Hidden Valley before continuing to their next raid, the Brotherhood arrived at Camp Golf in the late evening. By this point the NCR was on high alert, having their main supply choke point desecrated had shook them deeply. Before they had time to gather their bearings the Brotherhood launched their assault on Camp Golf, hoping to cripple the NCR's operational capacity for the following months. Lasers scorched the sandbags around the camp, the NCR soldiers falling in droves to the Brotherhood's methodical onslaught of firepower. By the time they reached the main building they'd killed half the occupants and set fire to the camp. Kicking in the door, they dealt with the NCR the way they'd dealt with the Van Graffs - like vermin. Splitting them up, cornering them, splitting their skin with laser fire. Camp Golf smelled of gasoline and burned flesh by the time the sun rose over the horizon."

 nf_mojave.8.d:0 "Hardin took what he was given and made something of it. A chapter on the ropes, a Brotherhood on the edge, reformed in fire and flame as an example of Brotherhood doctrine. Now, years after they originally departed from the west, the Mojave Chapter has contacted the Western Brotherhood to be brought back into the fold."

 nf_mojave.9.d:0 "A few days ago a messenger arrived at the entrance of Lost Hills. According to him, he comes from the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. The Elder of the Chapter, Elder Edgar Hardin has recently carried out a number of successful raids against the NCR settlements in Mojave and now wishes to officially establish contact with our chapter and join the alliance. What will we say?"
 nf_mojave.9.a:0 "The actions of Hardin are admirable. They are welcome in the alliance"
 nf_mojave.9.b:0 "The actions of Hardin are unacceptable. They are not welcome"

 nf_mojave.10.t:0 "Messenger Returns"
 nf_mojave.10.d:0 "The conversation was brief, but it told Hardin everything he needed to know, and more. His promotion to Elder was officially recognised by the west, and he was promised more men to continue his efforts in the Mojave. The Council of Elders condoned his actions against the NCR in the Mojave, sending their praise for his actions against the Van Graffs and Gun Runners in pursuit of their ideals. They didn't comment on their own situation beyond what was necessary, but their message was clear: the Mojave Chapter was part of the fold."
 nf_mojave.10.a:0 "Reunited at last"

 nf_mojave.11.t:0 "Messenger Returns"
 nf_mojave.11.d:0 "The conversation was brief, but it told Hardin everything he needed to know, and more. His promotion to Elder was not recognised by the west and he was labeled as an outcast. The Council of Elders condemned his actions against the NCR and the Gun Runners in the Mojave. They didn't comment on their own situation, but their message was clear: the Mojave Chapter was not welcome."

 nf_mojave.12.d:0 "'Long has the Mojave Brotherhood hid within out steel and concrete bastions, unwilling and unable to interact with the world around us. We must rise from our self imprisonment and reclaim the Mojave, and with it the responsibilities put on us after the fall of the Master. We shall once again work to cleanse and protect the wastes, and rekindle friendships long dead since the first war with the NCR. Now is not the time for old rivalries and bad blood long since spilled, now is the time for a better future, with the Brotherhood at the helm.' - Elder McNamara"
 nf_mojave.12.a:0 "The Brotherhood will thrive"

 nf_mojave.13.t:0 "Message to the NCR"
 nf_mojave.13.d:0 "Skirmishes with the NCR stemming from the years old Brotherhood-NCR war do nothing but damage both sides, and the people who live in the lands we fight over. We shall send a message to the NCR, hoping to enter into some type of deal with them, ensuring peace in our realm."

 nf_mojave.14.t:0 "A Message from the Mojave"
 nf_mojave.14.d:0 "An envoy from the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel arrived bearing a diplomatic message. The Mojave Chapter is under new management it seems, and they wish to work with us to secure their lands. After some deliberation, their diplomats and our negotiators come up with a deal that would allow our men to occupy their men, in exchange for free movement for their men within the NCR."
 nf_mojave.14.a:0 "Accept the Deal"

 nf_mojave.15.t:0 "Our Emissaries Return"
 nf_mojave.15.d:0 "The NCR was surprised at the arrival of our emissaries, but they were even further surprised by the suggested terms of the treaty draft we carried. After several hours of deliberation, the NCR accepts a deal which allows them to occupy the Mojave in exchange for members of the Mojave to travel freely within the the NCR's lands. Hopefully the friendly nature of our cooperation will allow further diplomatic discussion in the future."
 nf_mojave.15.a:0 "Excellent!"

 nf_mojave.16.t:0 "What Remains"
 nf_mojave.16.d:0 "Standing inside the vault at the heart of that facility, Elijah reflected on everything he'd learned in this place. Of the ten people he'd brought with him, only four remained at his side, but it hadn't been for nothing. The story of the Sierra Madre was a story of ravenous love, jealousy, and ultimately betrayal. How ironic that the woman he'd so desperately wanted to save died in her room? None of it mattered anymore, though. It was a drama 200 years in the making, the pages of its chapters long since written. What interested Elijah more was this vault, its contents, and the contents of the streets above. In time, he would take everything from this place for himself, but he had to prioritise something to start with. The most appealing of the Sierra Madre's miracle technologies were its holograms and its vending machines. The holograms were incredible, almost entirely invulnerable soldiers capable of killing any sort of intruder. One hologram in the right place could become a one man army. On the other hand, the vending machines were a similarly incredible technology. They were capable of creating anything they were programmed to create. They made everything molecularly, fabricating anything the user desired, in return for some useless currency. Seeing as Elijah had already discovered a way to trick the machines, their potential applications seemed limitless."
 nf_mojave.16.a:0 "We will take the security holograms"
 nf_mojave.16.b:0 "We will take the vending machines"

 nf_mojave.17.t:0 "Gun Runner Caravan Raids"
 nf_mojave.17.d:0 "Although the Van Graffs had been dealt with, there was another, more serious distributor of Pre-War weaponry in the Mojave — the Gun Runners. Established in the Boneyard, within the NCR's border, the manufacturer had expanded to many areas across the wasteland. The NCR is one of their biggest customers, although they only buy quality goods from them for a select number of soldiers. Their weapons are designed from pre-war schematics, making them not only quality, but also incredibly valuable to the Brotherhood. Hardin ordered assaults on their supply caravans travelling through the Mojave, in the hope of crippling the local NCR rangers, making life difficult for the Gun Runners, and gaining high quality weapons for the Brotherhood. As the raids progressed, however, the NCR began sending guards along with the caravans to deter the Brotherhood. Eventually, assaulting each caravan became like assaulting an NCR outpost. The Brotherhood couldn't continue like this. Switching their tactics, Hardin decided a much more drastic course of action was preferable. Amassing his forces for an assault on the Gun Runners' local production facility, the Brotherhood stormed the building and killed everyone inside. Looting any schematics they could find to keep them out of the Gun Runner's hands, they stripped the place clean before leaving."
 nf_mojave.17.a:0 "Gun Runners won't be selling their weapons in the Mojave anymore"

 nf_mojave.19.t:0 "NCR Trade Deal"
 nf_mojave.19.d:0 "The NCR is an economic powerhouse, and engaging in an open trade deal with them would be fortuitous for us. Sending out scouts to NCR industry to build rapport, and working on trade deals with the NCR government would be a nice first step to a proper economic alliance with them."
 nf_mojave.19.a:0 "Send our emissaries"

 nf_mojave.20.t:0 "Mojave Trade Deal?"
 nf_mojave.20.d:0 "More diplomats have shown up from the Mojave Chapter. This time they want to lay down a proper set of trade deals, and have also started contacting several companies within our borders."

 nf_mojave.22.d:0 "The NCR has refused to allow us officially trade with them, and further have disallowed our agents from making independent contracts."
 nf_mojave.22.a:0 "Uh-Oh"

 nf_mojave.23.t:0 "Sierra Madre"
 nf_mojave.23.d:0 "Left my heart in the Sierra Madre. Gone to Sierra Madre. I wish I was at the Sierra Madre. Messages like these can be found scribbled across the Mojave, left by fools young and old alike chasing a fleeting dream. If you don't find a poster, you find a postcard. If it's not a postcard then it's the broadcast — anything can pull you in, but once you hear that voice you're hooked. Elijah was the same as anybody else, once he found out about that old world jewel he was in love. That ravenous desire rooted deep inside of himself was enraptured by the Sierra Madre. He prepared an expedition force to travel with him to the Sierra Madre, ten members of the Brotherhood would journey with him there. They would set out in order to scour the ruins for technology. It was no secret that many a prospector had died exploring the Sierra Madre for salvage, and those who survived spun tales of a city akin to El Dorado. Rumours of mysterious technology unseen anywhere else drove Elijah forward, one step at a time. \"There's treasures there, sleeping,\" he told his group as their journey began. \"Some, awake.\""

 nf_mojave.25.d:0 "The Battle for Helios One had cost the Brotherhood a majority of their forces, resulting in a forced retreat across the Mojave to the safety of their bunker. Had it not been for the way Veronica forced her way to Elijah during the battle, he may well have simply abandoned his chapter to die. He knew this all to well. Mania, like a cancer spreading its roots throughout his body, had taken hold deep inside his heart. His determination was a fierce, rabid thing.\n\nHis subordinates had berated him the moment their voices wouldn't alert the NCR to their location. The anguished cries of McNamara were only drowned out by Hardin's bellowing anger, his face red from shouting constantly. They demanded answers. Father Elijah did his best to explain why he'd sacrificed so much for that place. He told them everything he knew about the facility, how its solar power generation was only half of its true purpose. No doubt they could use it to supplement their bunker's generator, but they could do so much more with it."

 nf_mojave.26.d:0 "The NCR, while open at first to the idea of some type of deal, laughed us out of the room at the notion that they should let us patrol their lands freely.

Traders from California were horrified to find the Mojave Outpost in ruins this morning. Its main building has been reduced to rubble, and the ground was scorched by as many laser burns as it was littered with dead NCR troopers. One of the traders who spoke to Radio New Vegas confided in us that, quote, \"I haven't seen anything like this since Navarro.\" It wasn't just the Mojave Outpost that was targeted however, folks. Soon after the NCR began to hear rumblings that something had gone bad along the I-15, Camp Golf was attacked. By the time the sun had risen in the sky and reinforcements had arrived, it was reportedly too late. The camp was set on fire at some point around midnight, and the main building was supposedly breached around the same time. These events have left the Mojave deeply troubled, and all fingers are pointing to the Brotherhood as the culprits of these raids. Today's headlines were not sponsored."

Grab yourself a bottle of sarsaparilla and stay hydrated. You deserve a treat. Now, onto the news. NCR patrols to Helios One were met with gunfire this afternoon, confirming the fears of NCR officials at Camp McCarren. \"Early this morning the troopers stationed at the power facility were attacked,\" an anonymous NCR officer told RNV. Reports from Novac support this, as many residents supposedly awoke to the sound of a large firefight. All reports end with a similar statement: right before the battle ended a large pillar of light turned the sky white. Onlookers described it as some kind of giant laser, and the smell of charred flesh that lingered afterwards, as well as the ash left around the facility seem to confirm this.
