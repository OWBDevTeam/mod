 nf_event_hea.1.t:0 "Legacy of Scripture"
 nf_event_hea.1.d:0 "The Heaven's Gate has always heeded the word of God, being directed by various prophets and leaders throughout its long history. Preachers have come and gone, speaking the good word to desperate people. Many verses have always held great weight with us, but none more so than the following."
 nf_event_hea.1.a:0 "Ephesians 6:11"
 nf_event_hea.1.b:0 "Isaiah 1:19"

 nf_event_hea.2.t:0 "Pilgrims Cometh"
 nf_event_hea.2.d:0 "Those who make the journey to Heaven's Gate often travel great distances, knowing in their heart of hearts that somewhere past the horizon is the last true bastion of godliness in this forlorn and forgotten wasteland. Yet when they arrive, there is always the question. Has their pilgrimage ended, or are they now dutybound to seek out and lead the faithful here? What does the bible say of such things?"
 nf_event_hea.2.a:0 "Genesis 13:15"
 nf_event_hea.2.b:0 "Psalm 23:4"

 nf_event_hea.3.t:0 "Pagans Cometh"
 nf_event_hea.3.d:0 "Those who do not hear the word of God may still hear of the Gate, and may still travel here. The concerns that we face in the ancient question of how to deal with those pagan visitors are eternal. There are those who feel we should protect and house these lost souls, and those who believe that we should reject them."
 nf_event_hea.3.a:0 "Corinthians 12:2"
 nf_event_hea.3.b:0 "Luke 12:30"

 nf_event_hea.4.t:0 "Innocence Lost"
 nf_event_hea.4.d:0 "Innocence is little more than a small settlement on the very edge of what we know, often visited by travelling pagans and tribals coming down from the northern wildlands. These people often arrive to trade and exchange goods, and in turn we teach them of God. Yet often, there are groups more resistance to this than others, those elders and warlike souls who feel that our lessons are an affront to their own misguided beliefs. Tensions run high, and our method of dealing with pagans will play a great part in what happens next..."
 nf_event_hea.4.a:0 "May God have mercy!"

 nf_event_hea.5.t:0 "Issue the Ultimatum"
 nf_event_hea.5.d:0 "The animist tribals of the Lonetree tribe have long stood independent to our south, surviving along primary land routes to the rich lands below us. We shall have to go forth and push them away, if only for the sake of travel. It is time for them to convert, we shall bring them salvation and open our southern trade routes."
 nf_event_hea.5.a:0 "What shall they say?"

 nf_event_hea.50.t:0 "Crusader Ultimatum"
 nf_event_hea.50.d:0 "The followers of the single God have come for us at last, long have we awaited this day. How shall we meet this ultimatum? With the pride of a warrior, or the wisdom of a sage who understands he can not win?"

 nf_event_hea.50.b:0 "The Sage's Wisdom!"

 nf_event_hea.6.t:0 "The Gate Offers a Defensive Pact"
 nf_event_hea.6.d:0 "Following the establishment of their embassy in our capital, Heaven's Gate has offered a unique proposal to us - that we join them in a defensive pact against any aggression we may face. Whilst there seems to be no strings attatched to the aggreement for the moment, the Gate has made it more than clear what might happen if we turn them down..."
 nf_event_hea.6.a:0 "Their protection is welcome"
 nf_event_hea.6.b:0 "We are safer elsewhere"

 nf_event_hea.60.t:0 "[MUR.GetName] Refuses!"
 nf_event_hea.60.d:0 "Despite our generous offer of protection, [MUR.GetName] seems to have decided that they can be better protected elsewhere. Heresy! How shall we respond to this transgression?"
 nf_event_hea.60.a:0 "We have other methods of 'protecting' them"
 nf_event_hea.60.b:0 "Fair enough"

 nf_event_hea.8.t:0 "Religious Fanatics Launch a Coup!"
 nf_event_hea.8.d:0 "After the steady work of missionaries from Heaven's Gate, a large percentage of our population is loyal to the religious extremism coming from Heaven's Gate. Now fanatical religious followers have attempted to seize power from us and bring our policy in line with that of the Gate. What happens to the coup?"
 nf_event_hea.8.a:0 "The coup succeeds"
 nf_event_hea.8.b:0 "The coup is put down"

 nf_event_hea.80.t:0 "Our coup fails in [From.GetName]!"
 nf_event_hea.80.d:0 "Following our conversion of the population of [From.GetName], we attempted a coup against the leadership to align the country with our rule. The coup was barely put down by army elements loyal to the existing government, however, and we have heard disturbing reports of these army units putting our followers to death in reprisal. Needless to say we must intervene."
 nf_event_hea.80.a:0 "Force is just as effective as faith"

 nf_mormon.81.t:0 "Coup in [From.GetName] Succeeds!"

 nf_mormon.82.t:0 "[HEA.GetName] Launches a Takeover of [From.GetName]"
 nf_mormon.82.d:0 "The religious nutjobs of [HEA.GetName] have launched a coup against the lawful government in [From.GetName], on the pretence of defending their followers in [From.GetName]'s lands. This marks the culmination of efforts by [HEA.GetName]'s missionaries to convert [From.GetName]."
 nf_mormon.82.a:0 "Keep an eye on missionaries in our borders, then..."

 nf_event_hea.9.t:0 "Religious Fanatics Launch a Coup in [From.GetName]!"
 nf_event_hea.9.d:0 "Following their persistent efforts to convert the population of [From.GetName], the leadership of Heaven's Gate have launched a coup against the government of [From.GetName] to align our puppet with them! The initial coup seems to have succeeded, so if we wish to wrench back control of the country we will need to launch a counter-coup."
 nf_event_hea.9.a:0 "Let them go"

 HEA_convertion_cw:0 "A §Rcivil war§! will break our between our supporters and Heaven's Gate's supporters!"

 nf_event_hea.90.t:0 "[From.GetName] React to Our Coup in [From.From.GetName]"
 nf_event_hea.90.d:0 "[From.GetName] was never going to like our coup in their puppet state. In response to our successful first takeover, they have launched a coup of their own to attempt to wrench back power. However, many militias rallied, formed of loyal followers, and managed to defend the capital from seizure. The country has been launched into a bloody civil war as a result."
 nf_event_hea.90.a:0 "Unite the faith"
