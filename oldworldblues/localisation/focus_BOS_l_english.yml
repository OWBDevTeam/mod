 bos_justice:0 "Justice"
 bos_justice_desc:0 "On October 10th 2077, less than a week before nuclear fire destroyed all that was and had been, Robert Maxson and his followers descended upon the West-Tech facility in hopes of finding resources and supplies. Instead, they found a freak show, a nightmarish realm of FEV and mad scientists. Robert was furious, and what he decided to do with these mad men would echo through the centuries."

 bos_glow:0 "The Glow"
 bos_glow_desc:0 "In 2134, after the formal formation of the Brotherhood of Steel, a splinter faction lead by Dennis Allen, who was among Maxson's original soldiers, requested permission to return to the West-Tek facility in search of technological artefacts. Understanding fully that this was the most dangerous mission ever presented to the council, he trusted his good reputation to garner him permission."

 bos_vipers:0 "The Vipers"
 bos_vipers_desc:0 "The War with the Vipers was a skirmish like any other, routine patrols engaging in small and one sided firefights with random raider gangs. But this time it was different, this time there were casualties. Maxson himself died hours after the engagement, writing in pain as radscorpion venom claimed him. This painful and horrific death lead to outrage among the Brotherhood of Steel."

 bos_oldamerica:0 "Old America"
 bos_oldamerica_desc:0 "The Brotherhood was not the only pre-war military outfit to survive the end of America, and that became overwhelmingly apparent with the rise of the Enclave. After years of passive observation and subtle manoeuvring, the Brotherhood of Steel joined the NCR in the final battle at the Navarro Outpost. This was in many ways, the opening of a new Chapter for the Brotherhood of Steel."

 # Underground Hangars sub-tree

 bos_hangars:0 "Underground Hangars"
 bos_hangars_desc:0 "Some Pre-War Military Bunkers come equipped with Underground Hangers, from with Vertibirds can ascend and descend in relative safety and obscurity. Many of these facilities also come with facilities for repair and ample fuel storage. Bringing them back online is necessary for power protection."

 bos_fighters:0 "Fighter Development"
 bos_fighters_desc:0 "Numerous  Air Bases contain the apparatus for training pilots, but training such people is pointless without the necessary machines. Follower order from the Council, numerous Paladin squads have been sent out into the wasteland to identify and recover information necessary to repair the wrecked fighters of the old world."

 bos_support:0 "Support Tactics"
 bos_support_desc:0 "In the last age, integrated air force tactics were all but essential, with bombers and strafing  runs existing to support ground infantry in almost every engagement. Ideally, any faction that could master and reintroduce such tactics into wasteland combat would gain an overwhelming advantage, but to do this? One must first uncover planes with the capacity for such support, and repair them.`"

 bos_airlexicon:0 "Air Combat Lexicon"
 bos_airlexicon_desc:0 "Our efforts in the wasteland have not gone unrewarded! Deep within the remains of an air force facility, a singular robobrain was discovered, struggling to maintain an archive of tactics and regulations former employed by the US Air Force. With his blessing, we were able to make a copy of this information for use in the future."

 bos_behemoths:0 "Air Behemoths"
 bos_behemoths_desc:0 "The Superiority fighters of the Old World are overwhelmingly powerful, and incredibly difficult to maintain. With intense fuel and ammunition requirements, many in the Brotherhood argue that that their combat effectiveness is far outweighed by the cost of producing them."

 bos_bombers:0 "Fortress Bombers"
 bos_bombers_desc:0 "The Fortress Bombers of the Old World are a nightmare to behold, a bustling fortress of machine gun nests and auto turrets to protect a payload capable of levelling all but the most fortified position. They are costly, but few can deny their viability in this new age. The ability to destroy foes without any risk of retaliation is appealing to all."

 bos_scourge:0 "Scourge"
 bos_scourge_desc:0 "In the past, the Brotherhood of Steel has made ample use of blimps as transport craft, but only recently has the novel idea of using them as floating weapons platforms come to mind. Such an undertaking would require an overwhelming understanding of their situational uses, and an in depth knowledge of all technologies leading up to this revelation."

 # San-Francisco Harbour sub-tree

 bos_harbours:0 "San-Francisco Harbor"
 bos_harbours_desc:0 "The Harbors of San-Francisco once played host to hundreds of massive ships from all around the world, military or otherwise, the shells of which still rest in ruined dockyards. Clearing out these wrecks, combined with a number of basic repair practices, could open up innumerable staging points for our budding naval forces."

 bos_seatrials:0 "Sea Trials"
 bos_seatrials_desc:0 "Encounters at sea are rare, but not entirely unheard of. Coast raiders prowl the shallow waters in vessels to fast to be caught in larger ships. The generally agreed upon answer to this is a small fleet of agile ships with which to capture and disarm any such foes."

 bos_navallexicon:0 "Naval Tactics Lexicon"
 bos_navallexicon_desc:0 "Using information given to us by a Ghoul who claims to be a former US Admiral, we have begun to compile information on naval tactics and the rules of engagement in a rough naval Lexicon, which shall become the basis for our approach to naval combat for decades to come."

 bos_screening:0 "Screening Vessels"
 bos_screening_desc:0 "Encounters at sea are rare, but not entirely unheard of. The NCR Patrol their extensive coast with a small fleet of heavier ships, coast vessels that are designed to scare off, not engage, raider vessels. If we are ever to challenge them at sea, we will need larger ships of our own."

 bos_seabehemoths:0 "Sea Behemoths"
 bos_seabehemoths_desc:0 "The notion of the battleship is appealing to all within the Brotherhood. The creation of an incontestable superweapon that would utterly secure our control over the San-Francisco bay area, and smash any aggressive fleets."

 bos_aircatapults:0 "Plane Catapults"
 bos_aircatapults_desc:0 "The Steel Cage, lovingly called the nest by some, has become the pinnacle flagship for our fleets. A pre-war cargo vessel outfitted with artillery heavy laser cannons and a new nuclear reactor. Its armour is nigh invulnerable, and many feel that it is this fleet that confirms our dominance at sea."

 # Brotherhood Expansion sub-tree

 bos_expansion:0 "Brotherhood Expansion"

 bos_optics_desc:0 ""

 bos_sword:0 "Draw the Sword"
 bos_sword_desc:0 "The NCR dares to wage war on us! We shall show them the error of their ways! Even now, dozens of eager young trainees are begging their instructors to be allowed a piece of the action. What better place to train Knights than the field of battle?"

 bos_navarro:0 "Navarro or Nothing"
 bos_navarro_desc:0 "Control of Navarro base was the singular grand reward for the Brotherhood following the battle of Navarro. The NCR has always rejected and loathed that we gained it in the following peace agreements, and will certainly seek to reclaim it. The word from the Elders is thus! Navarro or Nothing!"

 bos_citadel:0 "Citadel of Steel"
 bos_citadel_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel has not been tested in combat like this in many long years, an open war against foes who have the capacity to finally defeat us. We must be a Citadel of Steel against the hordes of the NCR. Unbreakable and defiant."

 bos_newsteel:0 "New Steel"
 bos_newsteel_desc:0 "The sudden need to produce and repair power armour in-mass has lead to the discovery of unnecessary and redundant systems and features within the armour, the removal of which can rapidly expedite the process of construction."

 bos_ghouls:0 "Ghoul Recruitment"
 bos_ghouls_desc:0 "Although it is heavily protested, man within the Brotherhood feel that desperate times call for desperate measures. The NCR has alienated ghouls in uncountable numbers over the last few decades, many of whom would happily side with us, if only to stick it to the NCR once and for all."

 bos_victoryforge:0 "Forge of Victory"
 bos_victoryforge_desc:0 "The Forge of War has left us stronger than ever, and with a refined need for things we often forsook, such as our civilian manufacturing and general economy. Using what resources we can spare, we push for great development."

 bos_victoryordeath_desc:0 " "

 # Internal Restructuring sub-tree

 bos_restructure:0 "Internal Restructuring"
 bos_restructure_desc:0 "The Brotherhood of Steel has had trouble with manpower for decades, due in no small part to a general refusal to accept outside aid. However, it is becoming increasingly obvious that such things are inviable, and that we shall have to change as the wasteland changes."

 bos_outsiders:0 "Outsider Recruitment"
 bos_outsiders_desc:0 "The recruitment of outsiders, those loyal too and who have expressed interest in joining the Brotherhood of Steel, is the first and most step for our push for recruitment. Although they are resented by many outside of our organization, these outsides will help to flesh out the ranks."

 bos_wastelandconscripts:0 "Wasteland Conscription"
 bos_wastelandconscripts_desc:0 "Previously, Wasteland Conscription has been something that only the most desperate of Elders consider, as demanding able bodied men and women from those townships that we defend is considered primitive and overtly tyrannical to most within the organization."

 bos_techreallocation:0 "Tech Reallocation"
 bos_techreallocation_desc:0 "Even the Brotherhood lacks perfect logistics, and vast quantities of technology are left to waste away in storehouses and bunkers. Rechecking the books and making sure that little is wasted will carry us far."

 bos_advancedcommunication:0 "Advanced Communication"
 bos_advancedcommunication_desc:0 "As strange as it sounds, most groups within the wasteland don't even attempt basic encryption on their files and valuable documents. The Brotherhood on the other hand, is constantly improving their firewalls and coding methods to be certain that only those who are meant to understand understand."

 bos_surfacetensions:0 "Surface Tensions"
 bos_surfacetensions_desc:0 "For decades, the Brotherhood of Steel has refuses to engage in outside activities, often leading the people of the wasteland out on a limb when it comes to protection in favour of more lucrative operations gathering technology. This has not only hurt our public image, but our moral as a force for good. It is time for the Brotherhood of Steel to again be proactive."

# Old Bonds sub-tree

 bos_oldbonds:0 "Old Bonds"
 bos_oldbonds_desc:0 "The Brotherhood and NCR have stood by each other in the past, if only because both are bastions of civilization in this harsh wasteland. Yet now, the NCR is threatened by a foe unlike any other, a horde of raiders and fiends so massive that even the might NCR buckles under the pressure. If California is to survive, we must act."

 bos_logistics:0 "Logistical Support"
 bos_logistics_desc:0 "The NCR take pride in their logistical support, gods know why. It's a mess, and they seem to lack all but the most basic of structuring. Simple advice and minor upgrades on their communication networks should make them a force to be reckoned with."

 bos_recruitment:0 "Recruitment Drive"
 bos_recruitment_desc:0 "The Legion is a foe without number, we shall need fresh paladins and soldiers if we are to face them in any effective capacity."

 bos_ncrforge:0 "NCR Forge"
 bos_ncrforge_desc:0 "Massive amounts of long hoarded wealth and technology are being channeled into the NCR's war effort, and their economy is buckling under the pressure. It has been suggested by several Elders that we go forth and reinforce the heart of the NCR's industry, Shady Sands, so that it might better stand against the tide."

 # Common Ground with Savages sub-tree

 bos_commonground:0 "Common Ground with Savages"
 bos_commonground_desc:0 "The Tribes of Umbra, far to the north, remain some of the last independent people in all of California. Yet even now, the NCR moves to civilize or evict these people. For the sake of securing expansions in the north, they should be brought into our sphere of influence."

 bos_union:0 "Camaraderie Union"
 bos_union_desc:0 "The Chosen One, who rules Arroyo, once saved the wasteland with our aid. As such, we have remained on good terms with them and their people ever since. Mayhap it is time to call upon such good graces, and bring them into the fold? An buffer state to the chaos in the north, and a limiter to the NCR's relentless expansionism."

 bos_seize:0 "Seize Arroyo"
 bos_seize_desc:0 "Why use words when force will do? The people of Arroyo are weak by far, and while we could bring them into an alliance, we would do far better by simply taking their resources and equipment as our own. They could do little to stop us, if we decided to march upon them."

 bos_homefront:0 "Trouble on the Homefront"
 bos_homefront_desc:0 "Tensions with the Shi have never been particularly good, but what can one expect when two technological powerhouses live so closely to one another? It is only by our good graces that they retain control over their own advanced weaponry and technology, although recent events now threaten this mutual understanding."

 bos_scrapsilicon:0 "Scrap Silicon Valley"
 bos_scrapsilicon_desc:0 "Silicon Valley has been explored by Brotherhood scouts and scribes for decades, in the hopes of finding new and rare technology. However, in recent years it has become overwhelmingly apparent that what the Brotherhood needs may simple be resources. Do we change the objective of the most recent expedition?"

 bos_exploresilicon:0 "Explore Silicon Valley"
 bos_exploresilicon_desc:0 "Despite our need for raw resources, such as metal, the Brotherhood of Steel shall stay true to its core function, the recovery of ancient relics and technological caches. The most recent expedition to the Silicon valley shall maintain its current goals."

 bos_strip:0 "Strip the Sub"
 bos_strip_desc:0 "The hollowed out remains of the Sub that brought the Shi to America have been resting in the harbour for decades now, a source of high quality, but hard to reach military grade steel and metal. The recovery and scrapping of this vessel could lead to a reasonable cache of resources."

 bos_slums:0 "Develop the Slums"
 bos_slums_desc:0 "The people of the Bay Area have long suffered from what one would expect. A lack of clean water, dedicated crime, and shoddy housing. Taking the time to render aid to these people could ensure long term loyalty to the Brotherhood, and give us just cause to place a series of high quality water filters in the area."

 bos_destroy:0 "Destroy Hubology"
 bos_destroy_desc:0 "The Hubologists have been wasting technology for decades now. Suicidal rocket experiments, attempts to civilize robots, and other innumerable inane projects that have only ended in disaster. They have squandered an incalculable amount of technology in their insane pursuit, but no more!"

 bos_civillians:0 "Encourage Civilian Business"
 bos_civillians_desc:0 "The people of the Bay are often fearful when it comes to opening storefronts or attempting to form anything resembling a business, because such things are often prime targets for raiders and gangs. However, with the promise of Brotherhood protection, we could usher in a new generation of Civilians loyal to the Brotherhood of Steel."

 bos_curbstomp:0 "Curb Raider Aggression"
 bos_curbstomp_desc:0 "The Raiders of the Bay Area have been a thorn in the side of the Brotherhood of Steel's operations for decades now, between harassing our patrols and smuggling out rare resources and equipment before we can get our hands on them, it has become apparent that they are something we need to deal with."

 bos_expand:0 "Expand Private Industry"
 bos_expand_desc:0 "Part of ensuring the safety of any given area is making sure that people are well armed and capable of protecting themselves when our patrols are not present. As such, developing the private arms industry in the bay area is necessary for our continued PR attempts."

 bos_steelrain:0 "Steel Rain"
 bos_steelrain_desc:0 "For too long have we struggled with and against the Shi. Their technocratic ways and willingness to tolerate crime in our area of influence have made it clear to man within the hierarchy of the Brotherhood that they are opposed to our goals, and as such, must be brought to heel."

 bos_shichapter:0 "Establish the Shi Chapter"
 bos_shichapter_desc:0 "The Shi could easily be conquered by our forces, but many within the brotherhood fear that such a choice of action would lead to the mass destruction of their secretive technological archives. Instead, an alternative method has been proposed... why not simply invite them to join us?"

 bos_demand:0 "Demand the Bay"
 bos_demand_desc:0 "Our recent show of force against the Shi has shaken the mighty NCR. We could make use of this moment and attempt to demand the NCR owned section of the Bay Area, Point-Green."

 bos_emperor:0 "Audience with the Emperor"
 bos_emperor_desc:0 "The Emperor of the Shi has deemed us worth of a formal meeting, following the founding of our chapter. He is a marvellous machine, and while many are uncomfortable with the presence of this AI, many more are eager to hear the secrets he could teach us."

 bos_shisecrets:0 "Stolen Secrets"
 bos_shisecrets_desc:0 "The ground infantry of the Shi bring with them advance Gauss Weaponry, the likes of which can't be produced anywhere else in the wasteland. By controlling their areas of manufacturing, we can take such weapons from their producers."

 bos_shiseize:0 "Seize the Military"
 bos_shiseize_desc:0 "What remains of the Shi Military has surrendered, but could still have a purpose within the Brotherhood. Although they are resentful, many of them were merely conscripted by the Shi, and should be manageable with the transition to new leadership."

 bos_gauss:0 "Gauss Weapons"
 bos_gauss_desc:0 "The secrets of Gauss have been gifted to us by the Emperor himself, his cherished weapons offered as a symbol of friendship and continued alliance. Maybe he's worried we'd betray him if he didn't attempt to placate us? Either way, our gain."

 bos_vertibirds:0 "Vertibird Schematics"
 bos_vertibirds_desc:0 "The Vertibird Schematics stolen from the Enclave many years ago have been a long coveted secret of the Shi, who haven't entirely managed to master the air of their manufacturing. However, by combining our knowledge, we shall surely gain understanding that rivals even that of the former Enclave."

 # Mojave Veterans sub-tree

 bos_mojavevets:0 "Mojave Veterans"
 bos_mojavevets_desc:0 "The men and women of the Mojave Chapter are among our most distant relatives, due in no small part to a lack of communication and understanding. That being said, even they are willing to answer the calling, sending volunteers when the Brotherhood calls."

 bos_mojavesignal:0 "The Mojave Signal"
 bos_mojavesignal_desc:0 "For the longest time, the primary issue barring us from active communication with our Brothers in the Mojave has been their fault communication equipment, which is largely incapable of long distance signalling. The delivery of some of our own equipment to them should help to ease this burden."

 bos_genius:0 "Elijah's Genius"
 bos_genius_desc:0 "Elder Elijah is a controversial figure on the best of days, due to his overt interest in the pursuit of wonder weapons and technological miracles that he feels can save the wasteland. He is the embodiment of our ideals in their most extreme, and is willing to throw away anything for technology."

 bos_hardin:0 "Hardin's Tactics"
 bos_hardin_desc:0 "Head Paladin Hardin is the man that the vast majority of Elders now wish had been elected to take over the Mojave Chapter, if only because many suspect that the genius of Elijah has been wasted. Hardin is the man's man, a Paladin who honours the tactics and ideals of the Brotherhood, while also understanding the necessity of political flexibility."

 bos_foodforservice:0 "Food for Service"
 bos_foodforservice_desc:0 "The Mojave Brotherhood have had been hoarding ancient pieces of technology and data that could drastically improve the quality of life for farmers in rougher areas. Requesting these could give us leverage when it comes to conscription."

 bos_drills:0 "Boxing Drills"
 bos_drills_desc:0 "Hardin is classical in more ways than one, and his insistence on basic hand to hand training for all soldiers is considered to be subtle genius in the eyes of many elders. Instilling the habit of sporting combat in our warriors makes them more capable of taking and recovering blows, and more likely to maintain fitness without prodding."

 bos_software:0 "Study Securitron Software"
 bos_software_desc:0 "Elijah has spent decades working on reverse engineering the works of Doctor House, not the least of which has involved taking apart and analysing what it is that makes Securitrons more capable than the average robot. "

 bos_mojaveequip:0 "Mojave Equipment"
 bos_mojaveequip_desc:0 "The Mojave Brotherhood of Steel works in what might be the most inhospitable heat imaginable, and have developed a number of specialized weapon maintenance routines to keep their weapons in working order."

 bos_hardware:0 "Study Securitron Hardware"
 bos_hardware_desc:0 "Years of taking Securitrons apart has given Elijah a deep insight into many of a secrets and techniques used by RobCo to outdo their rivals. As the Securitrons were among the most advanced robots ever created by Pre War America."

 bos_logisticaltech:0 "Logistical Technology"
 bos_logisticaltech_desc:0 "Due in part to their deep tendency to resort to deep reconnaissance behind enemy lines, the men and women under Hardin's command can easily teach us how to do more with less. Supplies are everything to a soldier in the field."

 bos_plantations:0 "Industrial Plantations"
 bos_plantations_desc:0 "Elijah has requested that we provide him with the fixings necessary to expand his own industry and general logistical capacity. Providing him with such will continue to earn this wildcard's loyalty."

 bos_foundry:0 "Laser Foundry"
 bos_foundry_desc:0 "Hardin has asked what we expected of him, the means of producing weapons so that he might better protect the interests of his chapter, and thus the Brotherhood at large."

 bos_plant:0 "Sarsaparilla Plant"
 bos_plant_desc:0 "An expeditionary team has been sent to the Sunset Sarsaparilla plant in the Mojave with the intent of recovering a series of rare technological caches and half functional robots that could be repaired and repurposed for war."

 bos_militia:0 "Organised Militia"
 bos_militia_desc:0 "Hardin is more willing that most members of the Brotherhood to resort to taking outside help, and getting involved in outside conflicts. To this end, we find that he has garnered the attention and adoration of a number of smaller militia groups, some of whom he is willing to send to us."

 bos_recallelder:0 "Elder Recalled"
 bos_recallelder_desc:0 "The Mojave Chapter has operated as a Semi-Independent entity for far too long now, recalling their Elder to meet with the council should hopefully remind them who it is they serve, and bring them back into the fold of our overall goals."

 # Blueprint Recovery sub-tree


 bos_blueprints:0 "Blueprint Recovery"
 bos_blueprints_desc:0 "We have gathered, over the last few hundred years, innumerable computers with hidden information. While we have stockpiled them endlessly, often we have not bothered to extract their secrets. How many blueprints and schematics have we ignored?"

 bos_viperlogs:0 "Viper Combat Logs"
 bos_viperlogs_desc:0 "The first true conflict we ever engaged in was our Viper Conflict, which took the life of Elder Maxson and in many ways, introduced us to the horrifying zeal of some wasteland factions. To this day, we analyse these conflicts again and again, so that we might never forget these lessons."

 bos_scribemaintenance:0 "Scribe Maintenance Routines"
 bos_scribemaintenance_desc:0 "The Duty of a scribe is a sacred thing, for a scribe must constantly work to improve their knowledge of machines and technology, all the while striving to improve upon and master their construction and maintenance. "

 bos_mutantramblings:0 "Mutant Ramblings"
 bos_mutantramblings_desc:0 "Despite what one might think, the vast majority of mutants are hardcoded warriors with an innate understanding of military tactics and doctrine. Analysis of their ramblings and recordings has delivered us with valuable tactical data in the past."

 bos_armmaxson:0 "Arm Maxson"
 bos_armmaxson_desc:0 "The state of Maxson is where we draw the vast majority of our lesser conscripts, who are unworthy of our more advanced equipment. That being said, developing our ability to arm them in ways comparable or superior to the NCR is a necessary element of our self-defence."

 bos_reactionchambers:0 "Laser Focus Foundry"
 bos_reactionchambers_desc:0 "The focusing crystals in a given laser rifle are incredibly hard to recreate, and up until this point in time, impossible to mass produce. Thankfully, that has changed, following the recovery in essential blueprints."

 bos_navarrotacticaldata:0 "Navarro Tactical Data"
 bos_navarrotacticaldata_desc:0 "The tactical information gained from the War with the Enclave give the Brotherhood of Steel something it had never before had to deal with. Battle with a technologically superior foe. Teaching our soldiers to be more reliant on their combat abilities, instead of depending on superior technology."

 bos_supplymaxson:0 "Supply Maxson"
 bos_supplymaxson_desc:0 "The men and women of Maxson are our first line against invasion, the shield that allows the hammer of the Brotherhood of Steel to fall upon a foe. Supplying them with firearms and the ability to make their own is an essential piece of defensive stratagem."

 bos_simplified:0 "Simplified Designs"
 bos_simplified_desc:0 "The Common Laser Rifle has been the reliable companion to the Brotherhood of Steel for many generations. While many within the organization are pushing towards newer weapons, the older weapons are more than sufficient when it comes to dealing with any foe. "

 bos_oldworld:0 "Old World Focuses"
 bos_oldworld_desc:0 "The Advanced Energy Weapons that we are currently prototyping are both incredibly effective and incredibly hard to make. Looking towards the future will be essential if we ever want to make use of them, which means gearing our equipment towards their production now."

 bos_superioralloys:0 "Superior Alloys"
 bos_superioralloys_desc:0 "The Metallic Alloys used in the creation of power armor are hard to come by, and harder still to recreate. While we have managed to perfect this art to a degree, it remains limited to older, somewhat inferior suits of armor."

 bos_scraprefinement:0 "Scrap Refinement"
 bos_scraprefinement_desc:0 "Our ability to find and repair more advanced pieces of power armor is becoming more important with each passing day. Gearing and training more of our scribes to work on these projects will vastly increase our ability to later sustain their production."

 bos_surge:0 "Surge Research"
 bos_surge_desc:0 "Tesla Weaponry has been a long coveted and studied without our most secretive labs. Recent innovations have finally made the secrets of long-hidden magnetic coil management known to us. Soon, we shall be able to roll these weapons out!"

 bos_powermanage:0 "Power Management"
 bos_powermanage_desc:0 "Sentry Bots are, without a doubt, the pinnacle of robotic engineering, and something that the Brotherhood has long coveted the construction of.

 bos_developmaxson:0 "Develop Maxson"
 bos_developmaxson_desc:0 "What money we do put into the development of Maxson is invariably put into defensive outposts and locations. These help keep raiders at bay, and help to remind the NCR that it is our banners that fly here."

 bos_navarrooutpost:0 "Navarro Outpost Protocol"
 bos_navarrooutpost_desc:0 "Navarro is a fortress onto itself, but the surrounding area is largely lacking in any form of viable defensive position. Investing in fortifications in these key locations will help us to maintain our northern security."

 bos_bayarea:0 "Bay Area Reconstruction"

 bos_refurbishment:0 "Lost Hills Refurbishment Plan"
 bos_refurbishment_desc:0 "Despite what one might think, many of our older bunkers are in desperate need of repair. Even the Lost Hills, the seat of our power, experiences near regular blackouts and has issues with filtration systems. Simple repair efforts will help us prepare for an ambitious expansion scheme, meant to turn the bunker into a true underground complex."

 bos_maxsonoutpost:0 "Maxson Outpost"
 bos_maxsonoutpost_desc:0 "Further Fortifications in Maxson have come not because the elders have suggested them, but because the locals have demanded them. Enthusiasm is at an all-time high, and no raiders dare strike against those who stand under our banner."

 bos_rangerpaladins:0 "Ranger Paladins"

 bos_recreatemilits:0 "Recreate Military Industry"

 bos_navarrohangars:0 "Navarro Hangar Expansion"
 bos_navarrohangars_desc:0 "The Hangers of Navarro have been in shambles ever since we destroyed them during the Enclave War.

 bos_generatordesign:0 "Generator Redesign"
 bos_generatordesign_desc:0 "San Rafael has a large series of military-grade nuclear generators, cooled by endlessly flowing seawater, that have been dormant for decades. Rewiring these machines and connecting them with our facilities would give us an ample supply of energy."

 bos_brotherhoodarms:0 "Brotherhood Sponsored Arms"
 bos_brotherhoodarms_desc:0 "We have things that the Rangers lack and they have things that we lack. A simple trade of weapons for men would drastically improve both factions."

 bos_heartland:0 "Industrial Heartland"
 bos_heartland_desc:0 "As weapons continue to flow from the Bay Area, the need to improve roads and infrastructure is again made paramount to the Elders, for the crumbling roads are proving to be burdensome even after recent efforts to reinforce them were undertaken."

 bos_defense:0 "Lost Hills Defense Initiative"
 bos_defense_desc:0 "While lost hills is a capable and defensible bunker, it is, unfortunately, ineffective as a defensive line. One can remain safe in the hole for years, but defending the area about will require outposts and patrols in a far greater number than we currently encourage."

 bos_dockyards:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
 bos_dockyards_desc:0 "The coast of California is littered with ancient ports and dockyards that have long been little more than scavenging locations. If are are to contest the NCR at sea, we shall need to put greater effort into our efforts to revitalize these locations."

 bos_navarrofacilities:0 "Navarro Facilities Expansion"
 bos_navarrofacilities_desc:0 "Numerous armories and repair stations remain in Navarro, but many are unmanned and in a state of ill repair. These places would be ideal for training a new generation of scribes in the production of more advanced equipment."

 bos_renovatearms_desc:0 "Our efforts to establish the militant heartland of California's old industry have gone well, but further effort could still be applied to gain greater effectiveness in these places."

 bos_losthillsexpansion:0 "Lost Hills Expansion"
 bos_losthillsexpansion_desc:0 "The effort to expand the subterranean complex of the Lost Hills Bunker have gone off supremely, and even now, more effort is being channeled towards upgrading our other bunkers! Let it not be said that we are vulnerable to outside attack."

 bos_vandenberg:0 "Vandenberg Expedition"
 bos_vandenberg_desc:0 "Another day? Another ambitious young paladin with the dream of an expedition to a secretive pre-war facility. Vandenberg has long been a coveted prize, and one that is relatively close to home."

 bos_hammer:0 "The Hammer"
 bos_hammer_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers employ a training regime that focuses heavily on ridged, old world tactics, not unlike our warriors. However, they often make use of unnecessary drills and tactics that have no value in the post-nuclear world. We should help them trim these wasteful practices."

 bos_westforge:0 "Forge the West"
 bos_westforge_desc:0 "The Bay Area is flourishing following our investments! Strong roads and a potent weapons industry have brought traders from across California to buy and barter within our controlled locations."

 bos_hangarconstruction:0 "Hangar Construction"
 bos_hangarconstruction_desc:0 "The Lost Hills Bunker never possessed any effective Hanger Bay, and as such could not launch smaller craft. The most recent answer, although expensive, is a simple remedy. The construction of an above ground landing strip and a hanger bay. "

 bos_secrets:0 "Navarro's Secrets"
 bos_secrets_desc:0 "The information we gained from Navarro was so heavily encrypted that it was only recently that we gained any meaningful breakthroughs with it. It fights us every step of the way, but we are slowly unraveling the Enclave's secrets."

 bos_anvil:0 "The Anvil"
 bos_anvil_desc:0 "The offensive doctrine of the largely reactionary Desert Rangers lacks in many ways. They detest shock tactics and don't incorporate advanced technology into their ground assaults. We must remind them that power armor is designed around these tactical actions and that they shall have to adapt."

 bos_steelfortress:0 "Fortress of Steel"
 bos_steelfortress_desc:0 "Between radio towers and further above ground fortifications, it can be said that the Lost Hills Bunker is a near impenetrable fortress, ringed with flags that bear the symbol of steel."

 bos_steel:0 "The Steel"
 bos_steel_desc:0 "The Rangers have been gifted a number of our more secretive production equipment, which should hopefully allow them to better produce and arm themselves with our weapons of war."

 bos_scribelexicon:0 "Scribe Lexicon"
 bos_scribelexicon_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers are, generally speaking, lacking in advanced weapons despite possessing the ability to produce them. A simple exchange of blueprints should allow us to catch them up."

 bos_powerarmourdevelop:0 "Power Armor Development"
 bos_powerarmourdevelop_desc:0 "An industry geared to produce something as complex and resource intensive as power armor can be easily regeared to do almost anything else."

 bos_zeppelinfoundry:0 "Zeppelin Foundry"
 bos_zeppelinfoundry_desc:0 "Long Ago, a vast fleet of Zeppelins were used to stage a massive expedition to the east. Now, decades later, we again find ourselves in need of such airships, and find ourselves making moves to repair the foundries of old.."

 bos_maxsongifts:0 "Maxson's Gifts"
 bos_maxsongifts_desc:0 "Who needs new technology when we have reliable and maintainable equipment already? Maxon's gifts are more than enough for us, and we do not need to replace them anytime soon."

 bos_forbiddensecrets:0 "Forbidden Secrets"
 bos_forbiddensecrets_desc:0 "The Power Armor of the Enclave was thought to be irreplicable by many of our most senior scribes, yet the steady work of our most skilled technicians has shown us that one needs not worry about replication when you have the core schematics on hand."

 bos_forbiddenweapons:0 "Forbidden Weapons"
 bos_forbiddenweapons_desc:0 "The production of Plasma Weaponry, the long-standing hallmark of the most advanced factions in the wasteland, was once thought impossible. With the aid of information stolen from the Enclave, we believe our facilities can be retrofitted to produce them on mass!"
