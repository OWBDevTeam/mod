 brk_nf_our_fathers:0 "Our Ancestors"
 brk_nf_our_fathers_desc:0 "British Columbia was filled with all sorts before the Great War, and its survivors were no less complex. Indeed, the pirates of the broken coast have all sorts of ancestries, but none of them are better off for it. They all stare down at the bottom of half empty beer flasks and wish for better days. Eventually, they all throw their caps on the countertop, grab their weapon, and head back into the Endless White."
 brk_nf_our_goals:0 "The Great Blizzard"
 brk_nf_our_goals_desc:0 "\"Back in Redbeard's day, there was a blizzard so fierce none but he dared sail in its winds. It clouded the sky for years, it stacked the coast with more snow than ever before or since, and it killed thousands. They say the wind howled with the fury of the dead. But Redbeard, that crazy bastard, never once got so much as frostbite.\" - Welt, former pirate captain, and owner of the Cap and Cash bar in Koover."
 brk_nf_our_gods:0 "Why we Fight"
 brk_nf_our_gods_desc:0 "Money has always ruled the Broken Coast. Much like how the waves dash against its jagged rocks with fury, so too are many hopes and dreams dashed by pirates simply looking for their next paycheck. Do the people of the Broken Coast enjoy the endless conflict their way of life provides? Maybe, but perhaps if they were offered an alternative, they might consider it. After all: everyone wants to retire eventually."
 brk_nf_grand_moot:0 "The Moot"
 brk_nf_grand_moot_desc:0 "Graven the Cruel received his title for a reason. Even by the standards of a nation of raider pirates, his methods are particularly sadistic and cruel. His right hand man, Ragnar, is much more moderate, and in line with the former leaders of the Coast. A Moot has been called to summon together the Coast and challenge Graven's authority: it will decide the future of our nation. Bets are already being placed."
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade:0 "Educated Pirates?"
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_desc:0 "A wise man once said: \"Give me a lever large enough and I will uproot the sun for you.\" Today, this wise man is little more than broken charred bones—but he spoke true when he was flesh and blood. If we want to uproot the wasteland from it's pitiful state, and therefore expand the Coast, we need a very large lever: technology."
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_1:0 "Educated Pirates"
 brk_nf_tech_upgrade_1_desc:0 "After much study, we finally have the lever to uproot the north, perhaps even the entire wasteland. For much of our history, the Powder Monkeys were mocked for the way they developed and relied on technology, but now we understand the error in our ways. Technology is the future, it will let us achieve whatever we set out minds on!"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol:0 "Graven the Cruel"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_desc:0 "Stories of Graven's adventures as a young man are savage, and chilling. His rise to power became increasingly bloodier, and his ascent to the head of the Coast was punctuated by the slaughter of the innocent. The betrayer's moot has invited rage into his heart, consuming what little remained of his humanity. Nothing will hold him back now. §RGraven's fury will echo across the wasteland forever!§!"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_1:0 "Solidify Authority"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_1_desc:0 "Blood. Blood was the only word you could use to describe the week after the Moot. Graven, truly unhinged by what he saw as the gravest betrayal, personally took to the streets and seas to hunt down almost every man and woman who voted against him. His hunt continues, but the damage is already done. Never again will the people of the Coast question Graven's authority over them—for fear of his wrath."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_2:0 "Enslave the Opposition"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_2_desc:0 "Graven returned to Koover at the helm of a ship adorned with the decapitated heads of his lesser enemies. Ragnar knelt there on the frozen dock, put in shackles weeks before by Graven himself, to witness the return of everyone he loved: §Rcoming back to port as rotting trophies.§! Ragnar is a broken man, a trophy commander for Graven, a fierce reminder that not even the strongest can oppose him."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side:0 "Graven´s Grand Palace"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_desc:0 "Formerly known as the Vancouver Town Hall, the towering concrete structure that once held meetings on public spending now hosts bloody contests of strength, drug fuelled sex, and an army of the loyalist men Graven's regime has to offer. To stand within his palace and gaze upon his statue of himself is an honour, or so he says. The walls are filled with eyes, and once a man steps out of line: he never leaves."
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_1:0 "Graven´s Palace Ship"
 brk_nf_ruler_pol_side_1_desc:0 "Graven, still consumed by rage and paranoia from his betrayal at the Moot, has designed a ship fit for a conqueror such as himself. It has every accommodation possible, making it a floating pleasure palace, but unlike most jet dens it also has enough firepower to level anything it might encounter. Graven demands his magnum opus be constructed, and his men can do little but obey."
 brk_nf_wife_of_conquest:0 "Trophy Wife"
 brk_nf_wife_of_conquest_desc:0 "The \"Collared Queen\" sits atop her throne alone, broken, and devoid of life. Once the shining beauty of her proud island nation, Queen Victoria is little more than a doll for Graven's sadistic perversions now, having captured her himself during the siege of New Victoria. Although she isn't tortured and mutilated like most of his other captives, her suffering is clear to any who look into her dead, empty eyes."
 brk_nf_wife_of_strength:0 "Martial Contest"
 brk_nf_wife_of_strength_desc:0 "Graven has two uses for a woman; either as a plaything, or as a tool. Clearly he has decided he desires a tool, declaring a gladiatorial contest for the reward of a place at his side. The sane would never participate, but the sane do not desire absolute power. Already, many a demented raider woman has signed up in the hope of taming the cruellest man in the north."
 brk_nf_elites_pol:0 "Ragnar the Mighty"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_desc:0 "Graven's right-hand man for most of his life, Ragnar the Mighty surprised almost everyone when he opposed Graven in the Moot. His name was not given to him without reason, Ragnar stands taller and broader than any man along the Coast. Having won by a narrow margin, §Rthis beast of a man must now build a staircase out of his dead followers to climb atop Graven's throne.§!"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_1:0 "The Duel"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_1_desc:0 "The taste of iron in Graven's mouth, a tear from his forehead to his chin where raw skin screams in agony, and the blurry sight of an axe half his size plunging down into his rib cage. With his shattered ribs littering the duelling grounds like confetti, Graven's rule is no more, and now none can question Ragnar's right to rule. All around him, men cheer, \"Long live §MRagnar the Mighty§!, slayer of §RGraven the Cruel!§!\""
 brk_nf_elites_pol_2:0 "Form the Broken Coast Warrior Council"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_2_desc:0 "With his victory unquestioned and the remains of Graven's powerbase running for the hills, it's time for Ragnar to solidify his authority. He believes that the Broken Coast needs a new system of government, where only the strong can hold court. Ragnar will construct a Warrior Council, §Mfilled with the mightiest men and women the Coast has to offer§!, that will decide the future of his lands one raid at a time."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side:0 "Establish Port Royal"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_desc:0 "Port Royal was once a hub of pirate activity if the old history books are to be believed. Ragnar desires more for our nation than a lifestyle of raiding to survive. Rather, he envisions a future in which our fleets travel far and wide not just for plunder, but for conquest, too. Creating a mighty port is the first step in achieving this goal."
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_1:0 "Black Flag Fleet"
 brk_nf_elites_pol_side_1_desc:0 "With his new port fully operational, Ragnar has laid out a series of plans for the construction of a vast fleet, named the \"Black Flag Fleet.\" He believes a large, modern fleet will make our pirates much more formidable, and plans to bankroll the project through sponsored privateering with the new vessels. With his plan, we essentially receive free crews and monthly repayments on our loaned ships: brilliant!"
 brk_nf_warrior_priests:0 "Offence Council"
 brk_nf_warrior_priests_desc:0 "Only the strong sit at Ragnar's table, and only the strong serve in the Warrior Council. Truly, Ragnar has created a system of \"might makes right\" that allows the strong and cunning to thrive. With all of their strength united under one man, this council begins to eye the Coast's weak neighbours, sharpening their axes and training their personal armies for the coming days."
 brk_nf_home_priests:0 "Defence Council"
 brk_nf_home_priests_desc:0 "It is undeniable that Ragnar the Mighty is the strongest warrior in the Broken Coast, and his legendary one-sided victory against Graven has been burned into the minds of everyone who watched it. The strong rule the weak, but all are weak compared to Ragnar. Realising this, the council members decide to train their men in various forms of defence, knowing that one day it might spare them Graven's fate."
 brk_nf_til_strid:0 "Call to Arms"
 brk_nf_til_strid_desc:0 "Throughout the Broken Coast, pirates gather in dingy taverns and upon the decks of their ships, bickering about the letters delivered to each of them. The Broken Coast has called upon all of its pirates to repay their debts to the state. Great conquests lie ahead, and any man who participates will be pardoned of his former crimes, or so they say. Many men would die for such an opportunity."
 brk_nf_frozen_shores:0 "The Frozen Cabal"
 brk_nf_frozen_shores_desc:0 "Far north of Koover, near the frigid border between the Coast and the Dredgers, the Frozen Cabal holds court in a fortress of twisted ice and steel. Their ranks are filled with ghouls who are one with the Endless White, and ancient pirates who've seen too much. Their guidance has saved the Coast many times in the past, and will continue to do so long into the future. Their mere existence makes all of us safer."
 brk_nf_raid_whistler:0 "Raiding Alvin Bleak"
 brk_nf_raid_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler is a nation of refugees, all of whom fled the rise of Kamlo. With their former homes lost to them and their spirits near broken, the people of Whistler are hanging on by a thread. We will burn Alvin Bleak to the ground and dye the snow red with the blood of their warriors. §RWhistler will remember the terror of invaders, and realise too late that running towards us was worse than staying with Kamlo.§!"
 brk_nf_demand_whistler:0 "The Return of Terror"
 brk_nf_demand_whistler_desc:0 "Whistler's forests are filled with frozen corpses, left preserved by the frost, their faces forever twisted in agony and horror as they clasp wounds long since frozen over. What little remained of Whistler's spirit has been stomped out by us, and now their lands are ripe for the taking. Whistler's remaining population will be thankful for arrival, even if they themselves don't realise it yet."
 brk_nf_integrate_enemies:0 "Breaking in the Conquered"
 brk_nf_integrate_enemies_desc:0 "With their leaders and loved ones left dead in the snow, the citizens of Kamlo and Whistler have nothing left but despair. Weak as they are, the truly broken are like putty, they can be moulded into any shape you desire. We will take these scraps left in our wake and convert them into a new tapestry of blood and conquest."
 brk_nf_lessons_of_war:0 "Drums of War"
 brk_nf_lessons_of_war_desc:0 "The North is a great expanse of territory, ruled by very few due to its harsh climate and remote location. Those farther south often mistake the north for a weak place, filled with backwards savages: this is their greatest mistake. The drums of war beat out a savage and primal anthem of bloodshed, encouraging our men to push onwards to the south, where the most lucrative of conquests await us."
 brk_nf_woo_whistler:0 "Silver Tongue Diplomacy"
 brk_nf_woo_whistler_desc:0 "Why waste men on conquest when it can be achieved through shrewd diplomacy instead? Shaking hands with the men of Whistler and smiling widely, our diplomat turns every sentence into a trap, §Rtightening the noose around Whistler's neck like a coiling snake§!. Today it's a tour of our dockyards, tomorrow it's a trip to their capital to meet their leader. Do they even realise the danger they're in?"
 brk_nf_protect_whistler:0 "My Army is Your Army"
 brk_nf_protect_whistler_desc:0 "With the agreements signed and safely secured, our diplomat has managed to finish half of his assignment. Whistler now relies on us entirely for their protection, having retired their small military in return fo a guarantee of protection from us. Little do they know this is just the first step in a rather fiendish plan..."
 brk_nf_aid_whistler:0 "Your Land is My Land"
 brk_nf_aid_whistler_desc:0 "Without an army the people of Whistler are entirely at our mercy, we effectively run their country for them. Moving our troops into key positions to shut down their government will help reinforce this point. However, our diplomat, ever the pacifist, has told Whistler that we'll pull out in return for some signed paperwork. §RUnfortunately for Whistler, they'll be signing away their independence.§!"
 brk_nf_raid_kamlo:0 "Kamlo Raiding Parties"
 brk_nf_raid_kamlo_desc:0 "Kamlo is little more than a coalition of raider gangs flying the same flag. Their \"leader\" is little more than an unusually smart raider. Chem pushers and slavers thrive in Kamlo's borders, so we'll hit them where it hurts. Their previous jet and med-x stockpiles will go up in flames, and their slaves will be slaughtered. Kamlo will begin to collapse under the weight of its own addictions."
 brk_nf_break_kamlo:0 "Night of Horror"
 brk_nf_break_kamlo_desc:0 "Raiders only respect one thing: strength. We know this, as the Broken Coast is as much a raider nation as Kamlo. Kamlo has already begun to retaliate against our raids, so it's time to show them how real raiders act. A campaign of carnage shall spread throughout Kamlo tonight. Drugged up raiding parties will tear the throats out of raiders with their bare teeth, scalping slaves for fun as the screaming fills the air."
 brk_nf_enslave_kamlo:0 "Breaking Kamlo"
 brk_nf_enslave_kamlo_desc:0 "Without their precious chems the remaining raiders of Kamlo cannot keep their paranoia at bay any longer, instability fed by the night of our pure brutality still fresh in their minds. As Kamlo begins to collapse under the weight of its own degenerate population we will strike, crushing the suffering and insane hordes of raiders, §Rputting them all to the sword rather than letting them suffer any longer.§!"
 brk_nf_ignite_the_forges:0 "Igniting Steel"
 brk_nf_ignite_the_forges_desc:0 "It's time we get our factories up and running. We need guns for our warriors and we have the slaves to make them."
 brk_nf_salvage_parties:0 "Salvaging the Ruins"
 brk_nf_salvage_parties_desc:0 "It's time we send some slaves into the bigger ruins to find anything we can use."
 brk_nf_drive_the_cattle_home:0 "Slaves for the Coast"
 brk_nf_drive_the_cattle_home_desc:0 "Our warriors are too busy raiding and plundering to work at home. We must bring in more slaves to work the pathetic jobs."
 brk_nf_expand_the_forges:0 "Expanding Steel"
 brk_nf_expand_the_forges_desc:0 "Now that we have basic forges up, it's time we commit more slaves to the forge. This will increase our output greatly."
 brk_nf_water_purification:0 "Building the Purifiers"
 brk_nf_water_purification_desc:0 "For too long our people have suffered from dehydration from the lack of clean water. No longer. With this decree we will start construction of a series of great purifiers"
 brk_nf_slave_habitation:0 "Put Them To Work"
 brk_nf_slave_habitation_desc:0 "Now that we have the slaves we need to put them to work. Starting with repairing any random junk we could possibly use."
 brk_nf_scour_the_coast:0 "The Coasts Treasure"
 brk_nf_scour_the_coast_desc:0 "Pirates like their buried treasure. Our treasure is steel. We need steel to work the forges. Send slaves to the coast to uncover this valuable treasure."
 brk_nf_boon_of_njord:0 "Masters of the Waves"
 brk_nf_boon_of_njord_desc:0 "For decades we have ruled the waves around the Broken Coast. Now it is time for us to go even farther"
 brk_nf_slave_selection:0 "Elite Slaves"
 brk_nf_slave_selection_desc:0 "We need to pick the best slaves that we have to work in our factories. This will increase their production greatly."
 brk_nf_blessed_steel:0 "Blessed Steel"
 brk_nf_blessed_steel_desc:0 "Our steel is surely blessed by some higher power. We can build more forges than any known before us. We will destroy all those who stand against us."
 brk_nf_dig_deep:0 "Canadian Pipelines"
 brk_nf_dig_deep_desc:0 "Recently we found old pipelines used by Canada before the war. If we can salvage them it'll give us a great boon to our resources."
 brk_nf_slave_shedules:0 "Slave Rights"
 brk_nf_slave_shedules_desc:0 "With so many of our slaves dying from mistreatment, the slaves are starting to get restless. Instituting more restrictions in how the warriors treat the slaves will keep our workforce strong."
 brk_nf_smith:0 "Keeping Up Pace"
 brk_nf_smith_desc:0 "If we're to become the scourge of the seas then we must keep our industry at the top of it's game. Having our best minds work on ways to improve our industry should suffice"
 brk_nf_add_spikes:0 "Terror of the Coast"
 brk_nf_add_spikes_desc:0 "Adding spikes to our weapons and armour will not only terrify our enemies but also give us a practical edge against our enemies."
 brk_nf_add_plating:0 "Plate Warriors"
 brk_nf_add_plating_desc:0 "Adding more plating to our armour will give us more protection against not only our enemies but also the harsh weather. The more plating the better."
 brk_nf_master_smith:0 "Armour for the Coast"
 brk_nf_master_smith_desc:0 "Having high tech power armour would give us an edge over every one of our rivals. All our best scientists will work on getting us working power armour."
 brk_nf_add_more_spikes:0 "Empowering Terror"
 brk_nf_add_more_spikes_desc:0 "Adding spikes to our power armour will make our enemies run away like little girls. Our armour will be the envy of the world. No one will stop us."
 brk_nf_add_more_plating:0 "Powered Plating"
 brk_nf_add_more_plating_desc:0 "Adding power armour to our soldiers will make them unstoppable. The thicker the armour the better!"
 brk_nf_dockyards:0 "Port Tantalus"
 brk_nf_dockyards_desc:0 "If we are to be true raiders, then we must expand the docks. Starting with Port Tantalus."
 brk_nf_dockyards_1:0 "Port Koover"
 brk_nf_dockyards_1_desc:0 "Our capital city will have a glorious port. One to rival those of any major nation. We are the true terror of the seas."
 brk_nf_dockyards_2:0 "Port Sechet"
 brk_nf_dockyards_2_desc:0 "Our efforts to build a grand fleet continue in the city of Sechet. These will be the sites of the future."
 brk_nf_dockyards_3:0 "Port Cove"
 brk_nf_dockyards_3_desc:0 "Earl's Cove is one of our minor cities, but we can grow it by putting a port within it. It will become a major trading port for our people."
 brk_nf_longboats:0 "Ancient Raiders"
 brk_nf_longboats_desc:0 "Since the founding of the Broken Coast we have been the terror of the seas. Recent discoveries within North Koover have revealed some of the tactics used by our ancestors."
 brk_nf_longboats_1:0 "A Diverse Fleet"
 brk_nf_longboats_1_desc:0 "With the first steps taken, we can expand even more. Our fleet will be grand."
 brk_nf_longboats_2:0 "Raiding Experience"

 brk_nf_longboats_3:0 "Terror of the Seas"
 brk_nf_longboats_3_desc:0 "Our ships have far outpaced every other faction in the wasteland. Our hold over the seas are complete. Anyone who enters our waters risks our wrath."
 brk_nf_workshops:0 "Expanding the Capital"
 brk_nf_workshops_desc:0 "Our grand capital must be expanded to make room for more factories to produce any and all good we will need for expansion."
 brk_nf_workshops_1:0 "Sechet Expansion"
 brk_nf_workshops_1_desc:0 "Sechet is set to become one of our greater cities. Expanding the factories within it is only natural."
 brk_nf_workshops_2:0 "Factories to the Cove"
 brk_nf_workshops_2_desc:0 "The Cove is a prime location for expanding our industry. It has natural protection and is a good staging point for our fleets."
 brk_nf_workshops_3:0 "Tantalus' Gain"
 brk_nf_workshops_3_desc:0 "Tantalus' Pain is a small city on the coast that needs to be expanded to be able to host our growing fleets. Adding factories is a good start to making it a major city."
 brk_nf_recruitment_drive:0 "Raiders of the Coast"
 brk_nf_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "Our elite warriors are known as Raiders of the Coast. These are our best warriors. We must train more."
 brk_nf_recruitment_drive_1:0 "Rite of Passage"

 brk_nf_manufacturing_drive:0 "Full Speed Ahead"
 brk_nf_manufacturing_drive_desc:0 "If we're to become a super power in the region then we must focus our efforts on pushing out more weapons, armour and ships. Our industry will rival that of the Pitt."
 brk_nf_manufacturing_drive_1:0 "Master Builders"
 brk_nf_manufacturing_drive_1_desc:0 "Some of our slaves have shown understanding in construction. Free those who can build and make them Master Builders. We will have a workforce of the best builders with the docility of a slave."
 brk_nf_manufacturing_drive_2:0 "Fortifying the Coast"
 brk_nf_manufacturing_drive_2_desc:0 "If we are to become a power in the north then we must do whatever we can do keep our homeland safe. Construction of land forts must be a priority to keep us safe."
 brk_nf_new_victoria:0 "Put to the Sword"
 brk_nf_new_victoria_desc:0 "New Victoria is considered by many to be a safe haven. Despite its seat of power being squarely in our waters, their well maintained defences and active navy have prevented us from conquering them. But today marks the end of an era of safety for those weaklings. We shall probe their coastline for weaknesses, and strike their neglected northern ports. §ROnce they're at their weakest, the false queen will fall.§!"
 brk_nf_dredgers:0 "Enemy in the North"
 brk_nf_dredgers_desc:0 "The Dredgers have ruled their corner of the north for a long, long time. Prince George is well fortified and resistant to the blizzards of the Endless White, and its access to the river gives it a constant source of supply even when the water freezes over. Inside their territory lies much metal and other resources that can be used to build our fleet. We have never fought, only scuffled, but their mere existence prevents us from dominating the north. If we must kill them to claim the northern crown: §Rso be it.§!"
 brk_nf_pirate_coast:0 "Dawn of a New Age"
 brk_nf_pirate_coast_desc:0 "For as long as the Broken Coast has existed it has been at war with itself. Pirate captains brave the blizzards and sailing the rough seas for revenge, killing friend and foe for caps. But a new era is dawning: §Rthe epitome of our savage, bloody past§! and §Mthe strongest son of the Frost§! clashed, ending the status quo. Only one emerged victorious, and when he did, it changed us forever in the process. We are reborn!"
 brk_nf_bellingham_kill:0 "Reuniting Koover"
 brk_nf_bellingham_kill_desc:0 "Koover has long been divided between raiders and settlers—the river that splits the city acts as a natural barrier to keep them apart. For a long time the gang leaders and captains who occupy our bars have hungered for Koover. Numerous raids have been conducted across the river, always coming to blows with Bellingham's forces. It's time for us to claim Koover once and for all!"
 brk_nf_washbos_kill:0 "Seattle's Purge"
 brk_nf_washbos_kill_desc:0 "Seattle has many mysteries: the most prolific of which are stories of its ghostly occupants. Close inspection from a safe distance reveals that Seattle holds no ghosts, but rather, men in dark power armour with burning eyes. They drag unlucky wastelanders into unknown depths, doing who knows what with them. Seattle is the jewel of the North, a city filled with secrets and stories. §RIt must be ours!§!"
