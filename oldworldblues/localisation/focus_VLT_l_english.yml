 vault_brain_4a:0 "Human Breeding Programs"
 vault_brain_4a_desc: "Unlike mole rats, humans are slow and cumbersome things. Focused on irrelevant things like love and want. Our new control apparati shall allow us to force them to forgo such needless obstacles."

 vault_first_3:0 "Population Controls"
 vault_first_3_desc: "Vault City is always growing, and there are endless streams of people wishing to join our utopia. By losing intellectual requirements, but increasing moral and mental screenings, we might better assess who is worthy of being a citizen."

 vault_first_4b_desc: "A well armed city is a safe city, and what better way to arm a city than to encourage weapons trade?"

 vault_chief_1:0 "Courtyard Crackdowns"
 vault_chief_1_desc: "For too long has Vault City tolerated and feared the uncouth masses of the courtyard! No more! As to today, routine crackdowns by security forces will drive these scum away from our utopia."

 vault_chief_2:0 "Security Protocols"
 vault_chief_2_desc: "Our method of security is out to date, and focused to heavily on the use of turrets to protect the city. If Vault City is to remain safe, we are going to need superior guards. New training and recruitment regulations should aid in this area."

 vault_festus_1_desc: "Vault City is ours after all these years of Bigotry, but even now the revolutionary leaders are falling apart due to infighting! Festus has elected to simply run vault city as it was formerly run, by a council. Though this time? You have to be a ghoul to earn a seat."

 vault_festus_3:0 "Fully Restore Poseidon Nuclear Plant "
 vault_festus_3_desc: "For decades, Vault City has had the technology and know-how to repair the Nuclear Energy Plant we called home, but they refused! Well now we've got their stuff, and we're going to stabilize the reactor once and for all."

 vault_80s_roam:0 "Let Them Roam"
 vault_80s_roam_desc: "What the 80's truly desire is freedom to travel up and down the I-80, which they worship as some strange type of spiritual guide. We may be able to give them access to the road in order to end hostilities."

 vault_flock:0 "Cull the Flock"
 vault_flock_desc: "The warriors of the Pale Folk's tribe have been the nightmare of central nevada for decades, launching nightly raids on caravans and outlying settlements in their endless hunt for supplies.

 vault_flock_diagnose:0 "Diagnose Their Condition"
 vault_flock_diagnose_desc: "Our doctors have spent several weeks studying the condition of the Palefolk, who seem to sport a uniform genetic disposition to albinism. That is to say, they are all albino, and overwhelmingly sensitive to the sun. Some of their number have been taken for less than noble experimentation."

 vault_flock_goggles:0 "Share Our Goggles"
 vault_flock_goggles_desc: "The Palefolk are, by in large, incapable of going out during the day due to their their extreme light sensitivity. This has made them somewhat incapable allies, due to this severe limitation. A simple solution has been proposed however; we shall give them our vast surplus of Vault Tec Goggles."

 vault_flock_help:0 "Raise the Flock"
 vault_flock_help_desc: "The Folk owe us a debt they can never understand, and we like to make sure they remember that. In times of war? We can call on them to repay that debt, little by little."

 vault_flock_annex:0 "Subterranean Subjugation"
 vault_flock_annex_desc: "The pale folk tribe has lived in a series of underground complexes and caverns for the better part of a hundred years, and have remained elusive as a result. If we are to bring them to heel, we shall need to subjugate these long unreachable enclaves."

 vault_flock_filters:0 "Purify the Flock"
 vault_flock_filters_desc: "We have determined that much of why the Pale folk are the way they are is due to their heavily irradiated sources of water. The purification process, while costly, should free up vast reservoirs of water, and water is something wastelanders are always willing to pay top dollar for."

 vault_flock_brain:0 "Pale Giants"
 vault_flock_brain_desc: "My lord! The illustrious brain has demanded warriors for his conquests! It is time to gather some of these pathetic pale manlings and drag them into the vats!"

 vault_cyclops:0 "Eye for an Eye"
 vault_cyclops_desc: "The Cyclops tribe are warlike and violent in the extreme, a spartan culture that demands them to go forth to kill beasts and men to prove their place.

 vault_cyclops_eager:0 "Eager Warriors"
 vault_cyclops_eager_desc: "Despite having been bested by us, the Cyclops tribe remains surprisingly jovial? They are willing to fight for us, so long as we are willing to provide them with the means of battle..."

 vault_cyclops_fort:0 "Developing Old Fort"
 vault_cyclops_fort_desc: "The Conquered Cyclops tribe operated out of a large spanish mission, and it appears that not far from them? One can find a series of prewar mines in relatively good condition. Reopening them will be key in our operations going into the future."

 vault_cyclops_hounds:0 "Hounds of the North"
 vault_cyclops_hounds_desc: "The Cyclops tribe has fallen into a state of full subservience, and eagerly seek to do battle on our behalf. Loyal allies, or servants? It's hard to say, but even now. They rally to our side."

 vault_cyclops_help:0 "Promote Polyphemus"
 vault_cyclops_help_desc: "Polyphemus, the former leader of the Cyclops Tribe, is eager to aid is in whatever way we can. He asks that we let him leads his own men and then some. While many hold reservations about this, it can be said that he has been doing this for far longer than any of our commanders..."

 vault_cyclops_serve:0 "Forced Servitude"
 vault_cyclops_serve_desc: "The Cyclops controlled far more land than one would imagine for a relatively small and warlike community. Their spirit is strong, and must be broken. A few generations of forced servitude should do just the trick..."

 vault_cyclops_army:0 "Cyclops of Old"
 vault_cyclops_army_desc: "My lord! We have read stories, old books, thought records! Of the Cyclops, massive one eyed monsters who did terrible things to mankind! Is it not fitting that the brain should also have such warriors at his disposal? Such monsters?"

 vault_utopia:0 "The Utopian City"
 vault_utopia_desc: "Vault City is more than a place, it's an idea. A post war Utopia rising from the wastes! We are above all those around us for a reason, and it is for those same reasons that so many flock to this place, desperate to get even a smidgen of the glorious technology we have at our disposal."

 vault_med_reg:0 "Courtyard Medical Regulation"
 vault_med_reg_desc: "Many of the people that come to the courtyard come seeking the trickle down effect of our medical capabilities. We can't offer each and every person that asks a replacement limb, our ability make promises and quietly sterilize those too mutated to be of further use means we have excellent population control..."

 vault_draft:0 "Institute Courtyard Draft"
 vault_draft_desc: "The seething hordes in the courtyard are viewed by many as little more than an annoyance, a leech upon our resources. It might be true that more goes into them than they give back, but what they are is a ready pool of manpower, a meat shield against the horrors of the wasteland."

 vault_mil_sec:0 "Security Militarization"
 vault_mil_sec_desc: "The Security forces centred around Vault City have long been incapable of acting as a proper military outfit. Due in part to fears that they might overtake the city government, and because before there was never a need to expand rapidly. Now however? We find ourselves in need of organized training."

 vault_citizen:0 "Service for Citizenship"
 vault_citizen_desc: "Our greatest ability to call the common masses to arms is the promise of citizenship within the immaculate walls of Vault City. For them and their families in the future."

 vault_robo_sec:0 "Automated Security"
 vault_robo_sec_desc: "While recruitment is a viable option, many within Vault City would rather focus on the production of robotic guardians, due in no small part to their use meaning we don't have to hire and promise anything to the masses in the courtyard."

 vault_serv_1:0 "The Future of Servants"
 vault_serv_1_desc: "Servants have been integral to Vault City for as long as we can remember, desperate souls willing to sell themselves into pseudo-slavery for a chance at seeing the inside of our walls. However, times are changing, and there are rumblings of servants requesting workers' rights and reduced hours... "

 vault_serv_2:0 "Quality of Service"
 vault_serv_2_desc: "Many of our true citizens have complained about the steadily decreasing quality of servant work. Regulations and tests could be put in place to ensure that only the most skilled servants can get into the city. This would reduce the volume of our workforce, but many would say that it's worth it to keep true citizens happy."

 vault_serv_3:0 "Service Hours"
 vault_serv_3_desc: "We have been overworking our servants for decades now, notably our physical labourers who do tasks far away from the city proper, working as scavengers and resource gatherers. Working them as hard as we do has allowed us to thrive, but discontent among workers is running high...do we reduce work hours?"

 vault_downtown:0 "Renovate Downtown"
 vault_downtown_desc: "Downtown is the heart of our economy proper, and houses the vast majority of our skilled labour and services. Renovation for it is near constant, with much of our yearly budget going to expansion and subsidies."

 vault_courtyard:0 "Modernize Courtyard"
 vault_courtyard_desc: "The Courtyard has grown into a sprawling city in its own right, housing thousands of souls. It is also incredibly out of date, for it is a glorified ghetto with a crumbling infrastructure."

 vault_sec_station:0 "Security Station"
 vault_sec_station_desc: "Monitoring local radio waves and housing much of the guard, the Security Station is the closest thing we have to a military headquarters, and as such, must be a proper fortress."

 vault_wall:0 "Expand the Wall"
 vault_wall_desc: "Vault City is growing like the cities of old, and it has recently been pointed out that the vast majority of our people live far from our protective fortifications. A new layer of walls must be created to protect that which we've invested so much in."

 vault_second_city:0 "Integrate Courtyard"
 vault_second_city_desc: "The Courtyard problem has been troubling us for generations, for its citizens have been treated as second class all the while. The choice to integrate them into the city proper, proclaiming them a literal, but slightly superior second class should placate them for a time."

 vault_gem:0 "Gem of the Wasteland"
 vault_gem_desc: "Who can compare to the utopia that is Vault City? None and nothing! There are none with such innovative thoughts, such magnificent people, and such glorious technology as us. We are the Gem of the Wasteland, the last true oasis of the old world in a sea of broken, twisted metal. Let it be known to all!"
