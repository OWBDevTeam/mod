 startup.2.t: "Legion Campaign"
 startup.2.d: "As a player, the OWB Legion campaign in the early game may seem overly easy for many of the conquests and trials the Legion faces in the early game before facing the NCR. This is due to timing and sequencing with the AI, who even struggle with some of the base conquests at times. Enhancing these nations which will be on the warpath may in fact provide a much more enjoyable campaign as Caesar's Legion without providing nerfs on the Legion's own power. Therefore it is strongly recommended you enable the following option if you have any substantial HOI4 experience whatsoever."
