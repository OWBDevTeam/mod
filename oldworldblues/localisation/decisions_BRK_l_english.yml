 brk_raiding:0 "Raiders of the North"
 brk_raiding_desc:0 "The sight of our ships on the horizon strikes fear into even the bravest of men. From the farthest part of the Endless White, to warmer southern waters, our raids are spoken of in hushed whispers and fearful voices.\n\nRaiding is an act that will likely incur an aggressive response from our target. We can escalate our raids into larger conflicts, and eventually: §Rinto war.§!"
 brk_raid_borders_initial_raid:0 "Raid [From.GetNameDef]"
 brk_light_border_raid_defender_warning:0 "Preliminary Raids from [BRK.GetNameDef]"
 brk_light_border_raid_defender_warning_desc:0 "Raiding parties have been crossing into our lands from the Broken Coast, pillaging our settlements and looting our stockpiles. Soon the raids will come to a head - either with their withdrawal (carrying our loot with them), or a clash between our forces and theirs."

 brk_raiding_vic_desc:0 "The lights of New Victoria dazzle across the water, whispering of fortune and fame. The time has come for us to grasp the fortunes and fame for ourselves - it is time to raid [VIC.GetNameDef]."
 brk_vic_practice_raid:0 "The Practice Raid"
 brk_vic_practice_raid_desc:0 "Raiding is simple - you point a gun at some defenceless person and make them hand over their valuables. Raiding over water against a hostile nation? That's not quite as easy. Fortunately we have a small, relatively weak nation in the former of the [HAI.GetName] just off our coast - let us practice our raiding arts on them to give us a better shot in our raids against [VIC.GetNameDef]"
 brk_vic_raid_the_coasts:0 "Raid the Coasts"
 brk_vic_raid_the_coasts_desc:0 "The people of [VIC.GetNameDef] have lived in relative safety compared to those in the Endless White. They do not fear our flag, nor the sight of our boats. We must teach them to fear us before we can lord over them. Their coastlines are vast - far too vast for any army [VIC.GetNameDef] might have to effectively protect. This makes them the perfect starting place for our campaign of terror."
 brk_vic_raid_the_ports:0 "Raid the Ports"
 brk_vic_raid_the_ports_desc:0 "Now that we have terrorised the coastlines, it is time to intensify our campaign against the more defensible areas - the ports and the towns. Raiding these locations will prove more difficult due to a higher concentration of forces, but the rewards are well worth the risks."
 brk_vic_seize_winter_harbour:0 "Seize Winter Harbour"
 brk_vic_seize_winter_harbour_desc:0 "Winter Harbour is far from New Victoria's heartland: isolated and rich. It sits ripe for the taking by a coordinated invasion, but the question is - how should we do it? There are three plans..."
 brk_vic_wartime:0 "War for Victoria"
 brk_vic_wartime_desc:0 "Previously the prospect of looting the great city of New Victoria seemed like a dream. Now the dream is close to reality. It is time for war."
 brk_vic_terror:0 "Reign of Terror"
 brk_vic_terror_desc:0 "The people of the coasts and the ports fear our boats, but now all the people of New Victoria must fear our flag. Only once the fear is firmly rooted in their hearts will they be ours."
