 # Decisions #
 produce_consumer_goods:0 "Produce Consumer Goods"

 produce_consumer_goods_wtt:0 "Produce Consumer Goods"
 produce_consumer_goods_desc_wtt:0 "Whilst the war machine is vital to our survival, the people need their luxuries too. By switching some of our focus into the consumer domain, we can increase their support for us."
 prioritise_living_standards:0 "Prioritise Living Standards"
 prioritise_living_standards_desc:0 "It is by no means a stretch to say our people live in good conditions. They do not. The people are in need of some care and attention from us, so better now than later! The changes will be slow, but we'll get to a more stable society in time."
 research_consumer_tech:0 "Prioritise Consumer Technology"
 research_consumer_tech_desc:0 "Our R&D department is of the utmost importance to our nation. It develops new armour and weapons, upgrades old versions and modifiers what we find in the waste. Maybe it's be time we spend a bit of the R&D budget on things the people want, rather than what the military needs."
 basic_hygiene_education:0 "Basic Hygiene Education"
 basic_hygiene_education:0 "The people have forgotten the hygiene we once had in the old world. As a result, disease spreads like wildfire and people live in little better than pigsties. We should divert some of our precious time to educating them with better hygiene practices!"
 focus_on_internal:0 "Focus on the Internal Sphere"
 focus_on_internal_desc:0 "The populace have no great stomach for constant war - they crave we spend some time focusing on issues closer to home to improve their daily lives. Maybe it is time we listened."
 purge_elites:0 "Expel the Riff-Raff"
 purge_elites_desc:0 "The leading body has grown since we took power, expanding to be able to control the country effectively. However, some of the members of our elite are not loyal to our cause, but are careerists instead. They use our cause to further their own interests - it is time for us to remove them from amongst us. The people will undoubtedly be happy at this change."
 war_propaganda:0 "War Propaganda"
 war_propaganda_desc:0 "War is nears the cities and villages of our peoples. It is time to ready them for war in their homes - let us drum up a favour of war support, so that they may be ready to tackle any cause in the name of our country and the war effort."
 militarized_society:0 "Militarise Society"
 militarized_society_desc:0 "Let us drum up war support by increasingly militarising our country's society. This will make them more ready to respond to invasion, and more willing to support our aggressive campaigns."
 promise_of_loot:0 "The Promise of Loot"

 mobilise_people:0 "Mobilise the People"
 mobilise_people_desc:0 "We need to call on more of the populace to join the army, and we need them now. We must launch on a recruitment drive to get them into the trained reserves much faster."
 patriotic_boost:0 "Seize on Patriotism"
 patriotic_boost_desc:0 "The first war has begun, and our people are filled with zeal for our cause. We can seize on this boost now - the people will flock to our banners quicker, and will support the cause more in the immediate term, but the support will slowly ebb away!"
 extend_mil_production:0 "Emergency Military Production"
 extend_mil_production_desc:0 "In this time of war, we can draft in extra consumer goods factories to temporarily boost the war effort. The people will grumble, but the guns are what is needed now, not their undying support."
 focus_mil_research:0 "Extend Military Research"
 focus_mil_research_desc:0 "To win the war we need to pull ahead on the RnD front. Extra resources are needed to be diverted to our research efforts at the expense of some civilian research projects."

 encourage_weapon_production_desc:0 "More weapons! A common phrase amongst our leadership during this war. Rather than trying to devote more of our precious factories to the development of these weapons, we should encourage people to take to the weapons workbench and create their own for the cause!"
