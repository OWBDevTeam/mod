 nf_vault_city.2.t:0 "Crime Epidemic"
 nf_vault_city.2.d:0 "When our ancestors emerged from their underground home and built our glorious city with their GECK, the survivng vestiges of man were drawn to its brilliance.

 nf_vault_city.2.a:0 "Punish crime with servitude to the citizenry."
 nf_vault_city.2.b:0 "Enslave criminals for use as labor."

 nf_vault_city.5.t:0 "Future of the Servants?"
 nf_vault_city.5.d:0 "The Servants within Vault City have been abused for many decades now, and some are saying that they've had enough of it! There will always be replacements, but offering them rights now could instill a sense of loyalty that we have lacked up to this time.

Their life expectancy is at an all-time low, the opposite of what they asked for when they applied for servanthood. This abuse was once overlooked, but these days? Anyone can see at a glance that we're abusing the hopes and dreams of wastelanders. A simple change in policy could reduce the concerns of so many of these people, but then again... what's the opinion of a few wastelander's really worth?"
