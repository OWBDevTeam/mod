 NCR_securemojave:0 "Establish Mojave Outpost"
 NCR_securemojave_desc:0 "After our scouts returned with information on the Mojave desert, the new expansionist President saw fit to expand the New California Republic into the Mojave. A good start for this would be a Mojave Outpost, creating a guarded gate between California and Nevada."
 ncr_osi:0 "Office Of Science And Industry"
 ncr_osi_desc:0 "For too long, we have been too reliant on the Followers of the Apocalypse for our scientific progress, a radical group that opposes our Government. The establishment of a new department in our federal government to deal with scientific progress will solve this."
 NCR_long15:0 "Repair & Patrol The Long 15"
 NCR_long15_desc:0 "The I15 is a pre-war highway that connected the states of Nevada and California. Often called 'the Long 15' by roving traders, it is now a hub for trade between California and the Mojave. With our expansion into the Mojave, it would be beneficial to patrol and begin repairs on the Long 15."
 NCR_rail:0 "Rebuild Pre-War Railways"
 NCR_rail_desc:0 "Having control of railways would dramatically improve trade between the states of the New California Republic and would give us a great advantage over other Wasteland powers. The inmates in the Correctional Facility in Mojave can be put to work on this."
 ncr_boneyard:0 "Invest In Boneyard"
 ncr_boneyard_desc:0 "With new wealth and technology acquired from our war with the Brotherhood and our expansion into the Mojave, there is much room to improve the industrial capabilities of the Californian states. Angel's Boneyard, pre war Los Angeles, is one of the foremost, wealthiest and most important states in California, so this may be a good place to start."
 ncr_necro:0 "Invest In Necropolis"
 ncr_necro_desc:0 "With new wealth and technology acquired from our war with the Brotherhood and our expansion into the Mojave, there is much room to improve the industrial capabilities of the Californian states. Necropolis is sometimes known as the 'City of the Dead', however it has seen new life under the New California Republic, and would be a good place to establish industry."
 ncr_shady:0 "Invest In Shady Sands"
 ncr_shady_desc:0 "With new wealth and technology acquired from our war with the Brotherhood and our expansion into the Mojave, there is much room to improve the industrial capabilities of the Californian states. Shady Sands was the birthplace of the NCR and is one of it's largest cities. Our wealth should therefore flow back into Shady Sands."
 ncr_sciencecouncil:0 "Science & Technology Council"
 ncr_sciencecouncil_desc:0 "With technological progress becoming more important to the success of the New California Republic, the Office of Science and Industry could be reformed into the Science and Technology Council, with the President at it's head, giving it much more importance in the Government."
 ncr_nukes:0 "Nuclear Technology"
 ncr_nukes_desc:0 "We must be careful not to repeat the mistakes of pre-war governments, but with much pre war nuclear technology just lying around, it is certainly much safer in our hands, and can be beneficial."
 ncr_extra_tech_slot:0 "Improve Science Council"
 ncr_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "We can improve the Science Council and import more scientific minds, improving the research and development in the NCR Government."
 ncr_extra_tech_slot_2:0 "Expand Science Council"
 ncr_extra_tech_slot_2_desc:0 "We can expand the Science Council and import more scientific minds, improving the research and development in the NCR Government."
 ncr_secweps:0 "Secret Weapon Division"
 ncr_secweps_desc:0 "Our study of pre-war technology we recovered from the Brotherhood and Enclave wars has reached a standstill. With an established research department, we can expand this into weaponry and armour beyond even pre-war tech."
 ncr_gov:0 "Government Reforms"
 ncr_gov_desc:0 "Our government is based on the pre war government of the United States, the same type of government that caused the great war. This democratic government is steeped in bureacracy and corruption, which is more evident than ever as the NCR becomes overextended."
 ncr_keepoldgov:0 "Improved Republic"
 ncr_keepoldgov_desc:0 "Strength is achieved through adversity, and our government will only be improved if we recognise the problems with the Republic."
 ncr_revaluencrdollars:0 "Revalue Our Currency"
 ncr_revaluencrdollars_desc:0 "After the Brotherhood destroyed the gold reserve in our war, the NCR currency, now no longer backed by precious metal, has become almost worthless, with $100NCR being the same as 5 bottle caps. We can take steps to revalue it."
 ncr_ncrbank:0 "NCR Central Bank"
 ncr_ncrbank_desc:0 "Another way we can increase the value of our currency is to establish a Central Bank that will monitor and control our currency. We can reform the Republic Reserve into the New California Central Bank to achieve this."
 ncr_central:0 "Centralise NCR States"
 ncr_central_desc:0 "Despite years of internal peace, the New California Republic's states are largely decentralised, with some states holding a much greater influence over the government, and being run in vastly different ways. We can take steps to centralise our Congress and improve national unity."
 ncr_supcourt:0 "Supreme Court"
 ncr_supcourt_desc:0 "Pre War America had a judicial body called the 'Supreme Court' that ensured the President was answerable to the people, and held up the laws of the country. The NCR, as of yet, has no such system."
 ncr_militprop:0 "Military Propaganda"
 ncr_militprop_desc:0 "Another disadvantage of our democratic country is that, given the choice, most individuals choose not to die for their country. However, with a great enrolment of propaganda, we can gently encourage more people to sign up."
 ncr_technocracy:0 "Technocratic Government"
 ncr_technocracy_desc:0 "There was a pre-war movement that had dramatic succcess within America that called for the Government to be made up of experts of different fields, usually scientific minds. Though it will restrict democracy somewhat, it will definitely help our research and scientific growth."
 ncr_followers:0 "Integrate The Followers"
 ncr_followers_desc:0 "The Followers of the Apocalypse are a large group within the Republic, founded even before the NCR. Though some see them as a radical political group, they mainly are concerned with both the wellbeing and education of citizens. Seemingly, our aims now match, so it could be easy to intergrate them."
 ncr_enclaverems:0 "Intergrate The Enclave"
 ncr_enclaverems_desc:0 "Though the Enclave is long dead and buried, after our attack on Navarro, there are quite a few remnants throughout the Republic, who, due to their experience with greater technology, often become scientists. If we can out these remnants, and give them more powers, it would dramatically help research."
 ncr_national:0 "Streamline The Government"
 ncr_national_desc:0 "When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy  and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor,  it was considered a public service. Our enemies are at our gates, perhaps it is time to appoint a man to protect the NCR."
 ncr_defence:0 "Build Our Defences"
 ncr_defence_desc:0 "'A safe people is a strong people - President Tandi' \n \n The Wasteland is a harsh place, and war can come from any direction. We must be prepared for any eventuality and be able to build defence against war from any place. "
 ncr_why_we_fight:0 "Ministry Of Propaganda"
 ncr_why_we_fight_desc:0 "Though of course the controlled democracy we have implemented is for the benefit of the Republic, many of our citizens do not see it that way. Though we could use force, it is a far greater victory to make another see through your eyes than to close theirs forever. We can use propaganda to achieve this effect."
 ncr_militarism:0 "Military Spirit"
 ncr_militarism_desc:0 "If war should come to the Republic, we would not be prepared for it. If we teach our children from a young age the matters of war and loyalty to the state, we could inject a military spirit into them and prepare them for the inevitable war."
 neo_cali_empire:0 "Neo Californian Empire"
 neo_cali_empire_desc:0 "The world has changed dramatically since the great war, the wasteland is full of upstart empires trying to claw at the Bear. The Republic is weak and cannot defend its people against these forever. No, an empire would be the best for our people."
 ncr_inf1:0 "The NCR Army"
 ncr_inf1_desc:0 "The NCR Army is one of the greatest known forces in the post war Wasteland. In the Mojave Wasteland, it is rivalled only by Caesar's Legion, who gathers strength on the other side of the river. We should do the same."
 ncr_pwrarmour1:0 "T-45d Power Armour"
 ncr_pwrarmour1_desc:0 "Much power armour was recovered from the wars with the Brotherhood and the Enclave. Though the secrets to using it are lost to us, engineers have been able to strip out the servos, allowing regular untrained soldiers to use it, though it is incredibly heavy."
 ncr_pwrarmour2:0 "T-51b Power Armour"
 ncr_pwrarmour2_desc:0 "Our NCR Heavy Troop can see benefit from improved power armour, again with the servos stripped and salvaged for the NCR. The  T-51b was the top of the line in pre-war power armour and the greatest we can salvage."
 ncr_inf2:0 "Service Rifles"
 ncr_inf2_desc:0 "Though the NCR infantry is larger than most other Wasteland forces, the equipment quality widely varies on the troop and what they have salvaged. We must take steps to improve the quality of our Infantry's equipment."
 ncr_inf3:0 "Marksman Carbine Rifles"
 ncr_inf3_desc:0 "Though the NCR infantry is larger than most other Wasteland forces, the equipment quality widely varies on the troop and what they have salvaged. We must take steps to improve the quality of our Infantry's equipment."
 ncr_spec:0 "Special Forces"
 ncr_spec_desc:0 "The New California Republic Army has many special force branches, such as the NCR Rangers, Riot Troops and the Heavy Infantry Corps. These branches have much room for improvement and new ones can be created as the theatre of NCR war expands."
 ncr_range:0 "NCR Rangers"
 ncr_range_desc:0 "The NCR Rangers are as old as the NCR itself, and are a well established military force well above the levels of normal infantry. With the Ranger Unification Treaty, the NCR Rangers unified with the Desert Rangers, a legendary force feared all across the Mojave. Now the NCR Rangers are the most formidable force in the wasteland."
 ncr_prepforwar:0 "Poke The Bear"
 ncr_prepforwar_desc:0 "Tensions in the Mojave are running high, and everybody knows war is coming very soon. Caesar's Legion gathers strength across the river, and will soon strike out to try and take Hoover Dam and the Mojave. We must adapt our Republic to be ready for the coming war."
 ncr_production_effort1:0 "Fund The Crimson Caravan"
 ncr_production_effort1_desc:0 "The Crimson Caravan are the greatest suppliers to the NCR of weaponry. Giving additional funds to them will mean the production of more military equipment for the NCR Army."
 ncr_production_effort2:0 "Fund The Gun Runners"
 ncr_production_effort2_desc:0 "Though they lack the reliability and loyalty of the Crimson Caravan, the Gun Runners are just as old and can provide greater quality and quantity weapons. Allocating them additional funds will greatly increase the availability of weapons."
 ncr_coloradodefense:0 "Colorado Defense"
 ncr_coloradodefense_desc:0 "Though Hoover Dam will likely hold up against an assault from the Legion, the rest of the Colorado River is not so well protected. We can construct outposts all along the river, to establish a noteworthy defence."
 ncr_draft:0 "NCR Draft"
 ncr_draft_desc:0 "With war on the horizon, we can improve drafting laws to recruit more of the population. This will take time and political power that could be used elsewhere for diplomatic means, but may be needed if ties to other governments are cut short."
 ncr_support:0 "Gather Mojave Support"
 ncr_support_desc:0 "With the 2nd Battle of Hoover Dam around the corner, it would be beneficial to gather support from other powers in the Mojave, such as the Boomers, and to quench any opposition such as the Great Khans. This will take up much of our diplomatic strength and having good relations beforehand would help significantly."
 ncr_victor:0 "Victors At Hoover Dam"
 ncr_victor_desc:0 "We have won the 2nd Battle of Hoover Dam and as such have control over the Mojave. Efforts can now be made towards annexing New Vegas, and of course there is the matter of what to do with the losers of the war."
 mojaveoutpost:0 "Add §Y9 Land Forts§! on the Mojave-Californian border.\n"
 long15:0 "Add §Y8 Infrastructure§! across the Mojave \n"
 fakerail:0 "Add §Y10 Infrastructure§! across the Mojave and California \n"

 ncrhooverdambegin:0 "Begin event chain §Y"NCR Mojave Support"§! \n"
 ceshooverdambegin:0 "Begin event chain §Y"Render Unto Caesar"§! \n"
 ces_peacethroughwar:0 "Pax Per Bellum"
 ces_peacethroughwar_desc:0 "Caesar's Legion is an unstoppable war machine. We have rolled over tribes across the Wasteland, and there are many conquests to follow. We will establish peace through conquest, through war."
 ces_newmexicoinf:0 "New Mexico Infrastructure"
 ces_newmexicoinf_desc:0 "The outlying provinces in New Mexico were once the land of tribal barbarians. With the Bull now flying over them, we should improve the infrastructure of the provinces, this will allow faster movement of troops and supplies."
 newmexicoinf_tt:0 "Add §Y8 Infrastructure§! across New Mexico \n"
 ces_denverinf:0 "Colorado Infrastructure"
 ces_denverinf_desc:0 "The outlying provinces in Colorado were once the land of tribal barbarians. With the Bull now flying over them, we should improve the infrastructure of the provinces, this will allow faster movement of troops and supplies."
 denverinf_tt:0 "Add §Y8 Infrastructure§! across Colorado \n"
 ces_denverciv:0 "Colorado Slaves"
 ces_denverciv_desc:0 "The conquests of Colorado granted us many slaves captured from their tribes. These slaves can be put to work on buildings or trade, improving the production of the Legion."
 ces_newmexicociv:0 "New Mexico Slaves"
 ces_newmexicociv_desc:0 "The conquests of New Mexico granted us many slaves captured from their tribes. These slaves can be put to work on buildings or trade, improving the production of the Legion."
 ces_newmexicomil:0 "New Mexico Legions"
 ces_newmexicomil_desc:0 "The tribes we subjugated in New Mexico had many warriors and strong young men. They should not be wasted by being put to work as slaves, instead we can incorporate them into the Legion as soldiers, as Legionaries."
 ces_denvermil:0 "Colorado Legions"
 ces_denvermil_desc:0 "The tribes we subjugated in Colorado had many warriors and strong young men. They should not be wasted by being put to work as slaves, instead we can incorporate them into the Legion as soldiers, as Legionaries."
 ces_flagstaff:0 "Flagstaff"
 ces_flagstaff_desc:0 "Until we conquer New Vegas, our Rome, Flagstaff is our capital. The slaves we have captured in outlying provinces should be transported there to be put to work on buildings and such."
 ces_slavearmy:0 "Slave Army"
 ces_slavearmy_desc:0 "Our mass amounts of slaves could be trained and used to bolster our already great army. Though they will likely not be as effective as our trained Legionaires, it would certainly be a massive increase in size."
 ces_scienceslaves:0 "Slave Science"
 ces_scienceslaves_desc:0 "Some of the slaves we have captured or dealt in have backgrounds in science. Though we are usually opposed to massive technological progress, their benefits to the military cannot be ignored."
 ces_extra_tech_slot:0 "Follower Slaves"
 ces_extra_tech_slot_desc:0 "Some of our captured slaves were once members of the Followers of the Apocalypse. The information we can get from them will help massively with research and technological progress."
 ces_secweps:0 "Brotherhood Slaves"
 ces_secweps_desc:0 "Luckily, some of our captured slaves were also once members of the Brotherhood of Steel. Though they are tough to crack, we could recieve much information about pre-war weaponry and technology from them."
 ces_army_effort:0 "Legionaries"
 ces_army_effort_desc:0 "The Legionaries of Caesar's Legion are one of the most powerful forces in the Wasteland. We are almost certainly the greatest force in the Mojave, and definitely the best trained."
 ces_equipment_effort:0 "Vexillarius"
 ces_equipment_effort_desc:0 "The Vexillarius are elite units that are even above the Legionaries. They are also flag bearers, and inspire soldiers to fight."
 ces_equipment_effort_2:0 "Centurions"
 ces_equipment_effort_2_desc:0 "The Centurions are the most elite units of Caesar's Legion. They are exceptionally trained and wear heavy armour they salvage from defeated foes."
 ces_doctrine_effort:0 "Doctrine Effort"
 ces_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "The military doctrines that defined ground combat in the Great War are outdated. We must put our greatest minds to the task of shaping the military thought of tomorrow." 
 ces_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Doctrine Effort II"
 ces_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "The battlefield has changed not just in the interbellum years, but over the course of recent conflicts. We must continuously reevaluate our doctrines to reflect this."
 ces_pwrarmour:0 "Power Armoured Auxiliaries"
 ces_pwrarmour_desc:0 "Though we usually oppose using pre-war technology, the NCR have adapted pre-war power armour for their heavy troops. This is an advantage we must match by creating our own heavy power armour troops."
 ces_pwrarmour2:0 "Power Armoured Auxiliaries II"
 ces_pwrarmour2_desc:0 "Though we usually oppose using pre-war technology, the NCR have adapted pre-war power armour for their heavy troops. This is an advantage we must match by creating our own heavy power armour troops."
 ces_sonofmars:0 "Caesar, Son Of Mars"
 ces_sonofmars_desc:0 "By creating a religion around Caesar as the Son of Mars, the god of war, we can legitimize and create a military spirit throughout the Legion, inspiring zealotry within the Legionaries."
 ces_inculta:0 "Vulpes Inculta"
 ces_inculta_desc:0 "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Vulpes Inculta emerged victorious. This move will likely mean the Legion becoming less of a military force, but Vulpes Inculta has many strengths of his own."
 ces_lanius:0 "Monster Of The East"
 ces_lanius_desc:0 "In the civil war that became of Caesar's death, Legate Lanius, the rightful heir of Caesar, emerged victorious. Though some criticise his barbaric methods, he is undoubtedly a fierce commander and great conqueror."
 ces_caesargod:0 "Caesar, The God"
 ces_caesargod_desc:0 "Caesar's death shook the Legion, and resulted in many people losing faith in the Legion. A good move to counter this would be to replicate what the ancient Romans did, and deify Caesar, legitmising his heir."
 ces_rubicon:0 "Crossing The Rubicon"
 ces_rubicon_desc:0 "Caesar's ancient namesake once crossed a river named the Rubicon, an unprecedented move that pitted him against Rome so that he could usurp it as Emperor. Similairly, our Legion crossing the Colorado River signifies total war."
 ces_vault:0 "Securitron Vault"
 ces_vault_desc:0 "There is a vault underneath the Fort that seems to bear the markings of Vegas. Before we begin to prepare our conquest of Hoover Dam, we should investigate this."
